summarize the following article in 2 sentences:  Image-Text matching (ITM) is a common task for evaluating the quality of Vision and Language (VL) models. However, existing ITM benchmarks have a significant limitation. They have many missing correspondences, originating from the data construction process itself. For example, a caption is only matched with one image although the caption can be matched with other similar images and vice versa. To correct the massive false negatives, we construct the Extended COCO Validation (ECCV) Caption dataset by supplying the missing associations with machine and human annotators. We employ five state-of-the-art ITM models with diverse properties for our annotation process. Our dataset provides x3.6 positive image-to-caption associations and x8.5 caption-to-image associations compared to the original MS-COCO. We also propose to use an informative ranking-based metric mAP@R, rather than the popular Recall@K (R@K). We re-evaluate the existing 25 VL models on existing and proposed benchmarks. Our findings are that the existing benchmarks, such as COCO 1K R@K, COCO 5K R@K, CxC R@1 are highly correlated with each other, while the rankings change when we shift to the ECCV mAP@R. Lastly, we delve into the effect of the bias introduced by the choice of machine annotator.

Our proposed DeepDefend framework for detecting and preventing DDoS attacks in cloud environments demonstrates several notable strengths. It leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to enable accurate prediction, classification, and early detection of potential attacks. The utilization of CNN-LSTM-Transformer for entropy forecasting, genetic algorithms for optimal data pre-processing, and the integration of AutoCNN-DT for real-time attack prediction all contribute to significant improvements in the DDoS detection process. Notably, the inclusion of an autoencoder (AE) in our CNN+DT model has proven highly effective in reducing detection time."

Summarize and explain abbreviations when necessary: We explore several new architecture designs for score-based models using both VE and VP SDEs (details in Appendix H), where we train models with the same discrete objectives as in SMLD\/DDPM. We directly transfer the architectures for VP SDEs to sub-VP SDEs due to their similarity. Our optimal architecture for the VE SDE, named NCSN++, achieves an FID of 2.45 on CIFAR-10 with PC samplers, while our optimal architecture for the VP SDE, called DDPM++, achieves 2.78. By switching to the continuous training objective in Eq. (7), and increasing the network depth, we can further improve sample quality for all models. The resulting architectures are denoted as NCSN++ cont. and DDPM++ cont. in Table 3 for VE and VP\/sub-VP SDEs respectively. Results reported in Table 3 are for the checkpoint with the smallest FID over the course of training, where samples are generated with PC samplers. In contrast, FID scores and NLL values in Table 2 are reported for the last training checkpoint, and samples are obtained with black-box ODE solvers. As shown in Table 3, VE SDEs typically provide better sample quality than VP\/sub-VP SDEs, but we also empirically observe that their likelihoods are worse than VP\/sub-VP SDE counterparts. This indicates that practitioners likely need to experiment with different SDEs for varying domains and architectures. Our best model for sample quality, NCSN++ cont. (deep, VE), doubles the network depth and sets new records for both inception score and FID on unconditional generation for CIFAR-10. Surprisingly, we can achieve better FID than the previous best conditional generative model without requiring labeled data. With all improvements together, we also obtain the first set of high-fidelity samples on CelebA-HQ 1024 ˆ 1024 from score-based models (see Appendix H.3). Our best model for likelihoods, DDPM++ cont. (deep, sub-VP), similarly doubles the network depth and achieves a log-likelihood of 2.99 bits\/dim with the continuous objective in Eq. (7). To our best knowledge, this is the highest likelihood on uniformly dequantized CIFAR-10.

In information retrieval, Okapi BM25 (BM is an abbreviation of best matching) is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Stephen E. Robertson, Karen Spärck Jones, and others.
The name of the actual ranking function is BM25. The fuller name, Okapi BM25, includes the name of the first system to use it, which was the Okapi information retrieval system, implemented at London's City University[1] in the 1980s and 1990s. BM25 and its newer variants, e.g. BM25F (a version of BM25 that can take document structure and anchor text into account), represent TF-IDF-like retrieval functions used in document retrieval.[2]

Summarize:
Our work revolves around the concept of memory in neural architectures. Memory has been a
recurrent theme in neural network research, dating back to early works (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943;
Stephen, 1956) and significantly advancing in the 1990s with the introduction of the Backpropagation
Through Time learning algorithm (Werbos, 1990) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural
architecture (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Contemporary memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) typically utilize some form of recurrent external memory separate from the model’s
parameters. Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) (Graves et al., 2014) and Memory Networks (Weston
et al., 2015) are equipped with storage for vector representations accessible through an attention
mechanism. Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) were designed to
enable reasoning through sequential attention over memory content.
NTMs, followed by Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) and Sparse DNC
(Rae et al., 2016), are implemented as recurrent neural networks capable of writing to memory
storage over time. All these models are differentiable and trainable via backpropagation through
time (BPTT). Parallel research lines extend recurrent neural networks, such as LSTM, with data
structures like stacks, lists, or queues (Joulin and Mikolov, 2015; Grefenstette et al., 2015). MANN
architectures with more advanced addressing mechanisms, such as address-content separation and
multi-step addressing, have been propo

AXLearn is a library built on top of JAX and XLA to support the development of large-scale deep learning models.

AXLearn takes an object-oriented approach to the software engineering challenges that arise from building, iterating, and maintaining models. The configuration system of the library lets users compose models from reusable building blocks and integrate with other libraries such as Flax and Hugging Face transformers.

AXLearn is built to scale. It supports the training of models with up to hundreds of billions of parameters across thousands of accelerators at high utilization. It is also designed to run on public clouds and provides tools to deploy and manage jobs and data. Built on top of GSPMD, AXLearn adopts a global computation paradigm to allow users to describe computation on a virtual global computer rather than on a per-accelerator basis.

AXLearn supports a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition and contains baseline configurations for training state-of-the-art models.

Please see Concepts for more details on the core components and design of AXLearn, or Getting Started if you want to get your hands dirty.

Write a CUDA script that does the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve The Lagrangian expression:

\[
\mathcal{L}(x, \theta, y, z, \lambda_y, \lambda_z) := \mathcal{S}(y) + \mathcal{B}(y, \theta) + \mathcal{E}(x, \theta) + \lambda_y^T W_y (y - Bx) + \lambda_z^T W_z (z - x) + \frac{1}{2} \| y - Bx \|_{W_y}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \| z - x \|_{W_z}^2

where \( \mathcal{L} \) is the Lagrangian, \( \mathcal{S} \) is a function of \( y \), \( \mathcal{B} \) is a function of \( y \) and \( \theta \), and \( \mathcal{E} \) is a function of \( x \) and \( \theta \). \( \lambda_y \) and \( \lambda_z \) are Lagrange multipliers, \( W_y \) and \( W_z \) are weighting matrices, \( B \) is a matrix, and \( x, y, z \) are vectors.

Explain the fourier transform
Hey, suppose we have some exponential function, exp(x), where x is a dot product of two vectors divided by the square root of the dimensionality of the vectors -- that is, x = q . k \/ sqrt(d). Thus, expanded, the equation is exp([q_1 * k_1 + q_2 * k_2 + q_3 * k_3 ....] \/ sqrt(d).

Given this, we want to find some function phi, such that phi(q) . phi(k) approximately equals exp(q . k \/ sqrt(d)). We expect it to be an approximation, not exact. Specifically, phi should meet all these properties.

    phi(q) . phi(k) ~= exp(q . k \/ sqrt(d))
    if v has dimensionality n, phi(v) should have dimensionality n^n + n + 1
    the approximation to exp(q . k \/ sqrt(d)) uses the Taylor series

So, please recapitulate what I said above, clearly and precisely. Then reason carefully about how phi should be defined, such that phi(q) . phi(k) has the desired properties. Then give some PyTorch code explaining it.

Broadly speaking, our work belongs to those works that evaluate the capability of Transformer on conceptually simple, stylized but fundamental sequential modeling tasks, e.g. arithmetic tasks and in-context learning with simple function classes.  The advantage of such methodology is that we can rigorously evaluate the capability of Transformer in a specific aspect because we can access the groundtruth model that produces the training data. Below, we selectively review some of those works.

In a Parameter-Server (PS) based Asynchronous SGD training system, there are two learners. Assume
a learner sends gradients to the PS, PS updates weights and a learner pulls the weights
from the PS in zero amount of time (i.e. after learner sends gradients to the PS, it can receive
updated weights from PS immediately). Now assume learner 1 runs at about 1.4x speed
of learner 2. Learner 1 calculates gradients g[L1, 1] at second 1, g[L1, 2] at second 2, g[L1, 3]
at second 3, g[L1, 4] at second 4. Learner 2 calculates gradients g[L2, 1] at second 1.4, g[L2, 2]
at second 2.8, g[L2, 3] at second 4.2. Updates to weights are instant once a gradient is available.
Calculate the staleness (number of weight updates between reading and updating weights)
of g[L1, 1], g[L1, 2], g[L1, 3]g[L1, 4], g[L2, 1], g[L2, 2], g[L2, 3]. (g[Li, j] means i-th learner’s j-th calculated
gradients).

summarize this "Quantum computing is a field of computing that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to perform certain types of calculations more efficiently than classical computers. It takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement, to process and store information in quantum bits, or qubits.

In classical computing, information is represented using bits, which can exist in one of two states: 0 or 1. These bits form the basis for all digital operations. However, in quantum computing, qubits can exist in a superposition of states, representing both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This superposition allows quantum computers to perform multiple calculations in parallel, leading to exponential speedups for certain problems.

Entanglement is another key concept in quantum computing. When qubits become entangled, the state of one qubit becomes correlated with the state of another qubit, regardless of the physical distance between them. This entanglement allows quantum computers to perform operations on multiple qubits simultaneously, leading to even greater computational power.

To carry out computations, quantum computers use quantum gates, which are analogous to the logical gates used in classical computers. These gates manipulate the quantum state of qubits, enabling various quantum operations. By applying a sequence of gates to a set of qubits, quantum algorithms can be executed to solve specific problems.

Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize various fields, such as cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery. Algorithms like Shor's algorithm, for instance, can factor large numbers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm, which has implications for breaking modern cryptographic systems. Quantum computers can also efficiently simulate quantum systems, enabling advancements in materials science and chemistry.

However, it's important to note that quantum computing is still in its early stages, and practical, large-scale quantum computers are not yet widely available. Overcoming the technical challenges of building stable and error-corrected qubits, improving coherence times, and minimizing decoherence are ongoing areas of research. Nonetheless, researchers and organizations around the world are actively working to develop and harness the power of quantum computing for future applications."

We worked towards adopting fairness in the zone-level and order-level assignments in gig delivery platforms, motivated by the need to address the challenges the delivery drivers face. Consequently, we first developed \fairassign, a fair dynamic zone-assignment algorithm for allocating drivers to delivery zones, which leads to improvement in various fairness evaluation metrics when applied in real-world applications such as food delivery and e-commerce delivery. As a future work, the scalability and adaptability of the \fairassign\ framework could be improved by effectively approximating the LP involved in the framework using recent advances in deep learning for constrained optimization such as Primal-Dual learning.
Next, we introduced the \kfood\ problem and the \fairkfood\ problem as a step towards connecting the recent advances in online algorithms to real-world systems like food delivery and quick commerce. We proposed an online algorithm -- \docfood\ that outperforms existing semi-online approaches in low-to-medium order load settings. An immediate follow-up to this work is to design a more informed online algorithms using predictions leveraging past data and see if it works at par with existing semi-online approaches.

We effectively minimize the following problem
\begin{equation}
     \min_{a, b, e, \alpha, \beta}  \sum_{\text{Run }i} \text{Huber}_\delta \Big(\text{LSE}\big(a - \alpha \log N_i, b- \beta \log D_i, e \big) - \log L_i\Big),\label{eq:lse}
\end{equation}
where $LSE$ is the log-sum-exp operator. We then set $A, B, E = \exp(a), \exp(b), \exp(e)$.

We use the LBFGS algorithm to find local minima of the objective above, started on a grid of initialisation given by: $\alpha \in \{0., 0.5,\dots, 2. \}$, $\beta \in \{ 0., 0.5,\dots, 2.\}$, $e \in \{-1., -.5, \dots, 1. \}$, $a \in \{0, 5, \dots, 25 \}$, and $b \in \{0, 5, \dots, 25 \}$.
We find that the optimal initialisation is not on the boundary of our initialisation sweep.
```

Based on this, you can define  a dict like this:
```python

Explain to me how to implement Flash-attention2 for the gpt2 architecture provided by the transformers library using the lib flash-attn
CNNs, a specialized branch of DL, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in the domain of image analysis and processing. By deconstructing an image into multiple hierarchical layers, CNNs are adept at learning distinctive features at each level, facilitating the extraction of meaningful information from intricate visual data (Figure 2.7) (Chen et al., 2018). This multilayer feature extraction is particularly pivotal when applied to the assessment of structural damage in buildings, a task for which CNNs have been found to surpass traditional image processing techniques in both accuracy and reliability (Avci et al., 2021).

The ability of CNNs to discern and evaluate various damage characteristics is of utmost importance in the field of building damage detection. Conventional methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of damage diversity and complexity. In contrast, CNNs excel by dissecting building imagery into feature sets that can be analyzed to ascertain the presence and extent of damage, thereby overcoming the limitations of earlier approaches (Maeda et al., 2018).

Bu paragraflar ile aşağıda yazacağım paragrafı uygun şekilde birleştirir misin. anlam kaybı olmasın yada kendini tekrar etme. Buradaki atıflar kıymetli çünkü kaybetmek istemiyorum.:

CNNs, a specialized class of DL models, have demonstrated remarkable success in image analysis and description, making them particularly conducive for assessing the structural integrity of buildings (Cha et al., 2017). By extracting salient features from visual data, CNNs can classify images based on these characteristics, thus facilitating the accurate determination of building damage status—a critical application for post-earthquake RSDA (Gao & Mosalam, 2018).

what is precision in predictive alerts generated using machine learning
summarize the following text: We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 dif- ferent classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train- ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen- tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.

I'm working in audio. What is complex smoothing? This is the extracted text that I am trying to understand:

Use complex smoothing in the frequency domain to yield variable length time windowing in the time domain.  The following times might work well as a starting point for investigation.

Frequency	Period	% octave	Time
62.5 Hz	16.0 ms	100%	16.0 ms
125 Hz	8.0 ms	100%	8.0 ms
250 Hz	4.0 ms	100%	4.0 ms
500 Hz	2.0 ms	100%	2.00 ms
1,000 Hz	1.0 ms	67%	1.50 ms
2,000 Hz	0.50 ms	33%	1.50 ms
4,000 Hz	0.25 ms	33%	0.75 ms
8,000 Hz	0.13 ms	33%	0.38 ms
16,000 Hz	0.06 ms	33%	0.19 ms


This will only work well for relatively “on-axis” measurements of the loudspeaker.

Alternative:  Select the percentage-octave smoothing to implement variable windowing so that it relates well to hearing integration time.  This could yield too large of a window in the time domain (insufficient smoothing in the frequency domain)

Is there published research with the following idea?  In a RAG system, during LLM generate, aggregate attention statistics during generation.  Sum attention to the RAG created contexts, and use this aggregated attention as relevance feedback for the RAG system.  So for example, for a given query, if a given RAG retrieved context has low attention, it was not very useful for the generation, and perhaps should not have been retrieved.  Alternatively, if a context had a lot of attention, it was a good result, and should be rewarded.  This information could be feed back into the RAG subsystem to optimize it for later requests.

Summarize as a copywriter

In information retrieval, Okapi BM25 (BM is an abbreviation of best matching) is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Stephen E. Robertson, Karen Spärck Jones, and others.
The name of the actual ranking function is BM25. The fuller name, Okapi BM25, includes the name of the first system to use it, which was the Okapi information retrieval system, implemented at London's City University[1] in the 1980s and 1990s. BM25 and its newer variants, e.g. BM25F (a version of BM25 that can take document structure and anchor text into account), represent TF-IDF-like retrieval functions used in document retrieval.[2]

Write a subsection about the Ablation experiments. More detailed and substantial than what is described below. Please think quietly before answering.

4.4. Ablation experiments

We analyzed each component of the proposed MFFE through the ablation study. All experiments are conducted on CUB-200-2011 dataset.

4.4.1 Ablation on proposed modules

To gain a deeper understanding of the individual and combined effects of the modules constituting the MFFE framework, we perform a series of ablation experiments. The intent is to quantify the contribution of each module—PM, SD, and FE—to the overall performance of the model. The ablation results are summarized in Table ~\ref{Table2}.

Table 2: Comparison of accuracy on the CUB-200-2011 dataset with different module added to EVA-02-L.
The baseline model, employing the EVA-02-L architecture without additional modules, achieved a commendable top-1 accuracy of 93.39\% on the CUB-200-2011 dataset (Table ~\ref{Table2} (a)). Upon integrating the SD module into the baseline (Table ~\ref{Table2} (b)), we observe a notable increment in accuracy, with performance rising to 93.67\%. This enhancement of 0.28\% suggests that the SD module's capacity to differentiate between categories is crucial to the model's improved discriminative power. The FE module alone is added to the baseline (Table ~\ref{Table2} (c)), leading to an accuracy of 93.63\%. While the increase is more modest compared to the SD module, it nonetheless demonstrates the value of refining features to emphasize foreground elements that are pivotal for fine-grained classification tasks. The combined application of the PM and SD modules (Table ~\ref{Table2} (d)) results in a further uplift in accuracy to 93.70\%, outperforming the baseline with only the SD module. This indicates a synergistic effect, where multi-scale feature representation from the PM module complements the discriminating capabilities of the SD module. The fusion of the PM and FE modules (Table ~\ref{Table2} (e)), without the SD module, achieves an accuracy of 93.46\%. The fusion of the PM and FE modules (Table ~\ref{Table2} (e)), without the SD module, achieves an accuracy of 93.46\%. Finally, the incorporation of all three modules—PM, SD, and FE—into the MFFE architecture (Table ~\ref{Table2} (f)) yields the highest accuracy of 93.72\%. This result underscores the effectiveness of the full MFFE framework, where each module plays a distinct role that, when combined, leads to the most substantial performance gains.

4.4.2 Effectiveness of feature fusion in SD module

The core of the SD module lies in multi-scale feature fusion. In order to verify the effectiveness of the fusion in the module, we use t-SNE to visualize the salient patch features \mathcal{P_i} of each stage, concatenated features \mathcal{MS}_c and final fusion features \mathcal{MF}, as shown in Figure 4. Here the samples are randomly selected from 30 categories (testing set).
As can be seen from Figure 4, as the stages increase, the features between the same categories become more and more clustered. By the final stage, except for a few categories that are difficult to distinguish, there are obvious inter-category distances between other features. Categories that are difficult to distinguish may require features of other scales for better discrimination. We find that the concatenated features \mathcal{MS}_c is difficult to distinguish from other categories, and the clustering effect is far worse than that of the final stage. We guess that it is because other scale features contain more unimportant information, and simple concatenate is difficult to effectively distinguish categories, so effective multi-scale fusion methods are needed. The \mathcal{MS}_c obtained through multi-scale feature fusion can be clearly distinguished from other features, and categories that are difficult to distinguish can also be distinguished through multi-scale information.

Figure 4: t-SNE visualization of salient patch features \mathcal{P_i} of each stage, concatenated features \mathcal{MS}_c, and final fusion features \mathcal{MF}.

4.4.2 Effectiveness of FE module

The purpose of the FE module is to filter unimportant features and enhance important features. We intuitively demonstrate the effectiveness of this module through attention heatmaps for each stage without and with the FE module, as shown in Figure 5.
As can be seen from Figure 5(b)-(e), without the FE module, the model's area of interest is more cluttered and susceptible to background interference. This may also be the reason why the model misidentifies Bank Swallow as Gray Kingbird. After using the FE module, some background areas are filtered out, and some important discrimination areas can be well highlighted, as shown in Figure 5(f)-(i). As shown in Figure 5(i), the heatmap in the last stage has very few discriminative areas, which will also make it difficult for the model to identify correctly. However, the multi-scale fusion information of the four stages finally enables the model to accurately identify the bird.

Figure 5: Visualization of heatmaps generated from the model without and with FE. (a) Original color image, (b)-(e) heatmaps of each stage of the model without FE, (f)-(i) heatmaps of each stage of the model with FE.

4.4.4 Different Backbone Networks

To better discuss the accuracy improvement brought by this approach, we test the proposed MFFE on four mainstream ViT backbones. As shown in Table 3, the four mainstream backbones, including ViT, Swin-L, Mvitv2-B and EVA-02-L, can be improved after adding our proposed MFFE. The accuracy rate of EVA-02-L before joining MFFE has exceeded state-of-the-art approaches, which shows that when the capacity of the backbone is good enough, the performance in downstream tasks will be quite good. In this experiments, the pre-training dataset for Swin-L is ImageNet-22K, while the others are ImageNet-21K.

Table 3: Improvement of different backbones with our additional structure MFFE.
Backbone	Accuracy (%)
	Original	+ MFFE
ViT	84.47	85.47(+1.00)
Swin-L	91.53	91.68(+0.15)
Mvitv2-B	91.63	92.04(+0.41)
EVA-02-L	93.39	93.72(+0.33)

explain in simple terms the gene-centric view of evolution popularized by richard dawkins
Yes, you're absolutely right. In the context of using a mixture modeling approach like Mclust, the "modes" are equivalent to the components in the mixture model.

Specifically:

Each gene's expression profile across cells is modeled as a mixture distribution.
Mclust then identifies the optimal number of components (gaussian clusters) within this mixture model that best fits the gene's expression data.
The number of components essentially represents the number of "modes" or subpopulations that exist within that gene's overall expression distribution.
So in summary, when they refer to "modes" identified by Mclust, this is directly referring to the components or gaussian clusters that make up the mixture model used to describe each gene's expression heterogeneity across cells.

The number of modes and the number of components in the mixture model are synonymous in this analysis. Thanks for catching that and helping me clarify!

GIven above - why would expression of a single gene have multiple modes (or components) in gaussian mixture model?

The Emergent Abilities of LLMs Could Be A Mirage!

The best paper award in NeurIPs 2023 went to a paper claiming that the emergent abilities of LLMs could be a mirage!

The paper (link in alt) asserts that emergent abilities appear due to the researcher’s choice of metric rather than fundamental changes in model behavior with scale.

Let's understand some terms before getting into the details.

Emergence is a phenomenon whereby new properties may materialize in systems as their complexity increases. These properties can't be predicted from a precise quantitative understanding of the system’s microscopic details.

Emergent properties of LLMs are abilities that are not present in small models that manifest themselves in larger models (Sharpness), and their performance on specific tasks can emerge quite unpredictably and abruptly at scale (Unpredictability)

A lot of drama around LLMs taking over the planet involves emergence. Researchers argue that some scary emergent properties like free will and consciousness can magically manifest themselves in LLMS, and therefore, we have to pause, ban, and regulate AI research.

The paper excellently and credibly argues that the LLMs DO NOT possess emergent abilities - by this, they mean that there isn't anything sharp or unpredictable about them.

They show that smooth, continuous, predictable changes in model family performance appear sharp and unpredictable based on the choice of metric. So bigger models naturally and smoothly are more performant; there isn't some sharp jump in performance.

They also find that for non-linear metrics, smaller models are more performant than previously reported when they add additional test points to increase the resolution of the benchmark.

Overall, the point of the paper is that LLM behavior is NOT unpredictable, and in fact, larger LLMS are predictably more performant than larger ones. 

In other words, there is no scientific reason to believe that LLMs can magically become supervillains one day.

If there is one paper you should read about LLMs, I recommend this one!

TLDR: There is no magic voodoo happening with LLMs; it's all math and statistics... as all deep learning is

Please summarize and simplify this text:
One benefit of the simulation metaphor for LLM-based systems is that it facilitates a clear distinction between the simulacra and the simulator on which they are implemented. The simulator is the combination of the base LLM with autoregressive sampling, along with a suitable user interface (for dialogue, perhaps). The simulacra only come into being when the simulator is run, and at any time only a subset of possible simulacra have a probability within the superposition that is significantly above zero.

The distinction between simulator and simulacrum is starkest in the context of base models, rather than models that have been fine-tuned via reinforcement learning19,20. Nevertheless, the role-play framing continues to be applicable in the context of fine-tuning, which can be likened to imposing a kind of censorship on the simulator. The underlying range of roles it can play remains essentially the same, but its ability to play them, or to play them ‘authentically’, is compromised.

In one sense, the simulator is a far more powerful entity than any of the simulacra it can generate. After all, the simulacra only exist through the simulator and are entirely dependent on it. Moreover, the simulator, like the narrator of Whitman’s poem, ‘contains multitudes’; the capacity of the simulator is at least the sum of the capacities of all the simulacra it is capable of producing. Yet in another sense, the simulator is much weaker than any simulacrum, as it is a purely passive entity. A simulacrum, in contrast to the underlying simulator, can at least appear to have beliefs, preferences and goals, to the extent that it convincingly plays the role of a character that does.

Likewise, a simulacrum can play the role of a character with full agency, one that does not merely act but acts for itself. Insofar as a dialogue agent’s role play can have a real effect on the world, either through the user or through web-based tools such as email, the distinction between an agent that merely role-plays acting for itself, and one that genuinely acts for itself starts to look a little moot, and this has implications for trustworthiness, reliability and safety. As for the underlying simulator, it has no agency of its own, not even in a mimetic sense. Nor does it have beliefs, preferences or goals of its own, not even simulated versions.

Many users, whether intentionally or not, have managed to ‘jailbreak’ dialogue agents, coaxing them into issuing threats or using toxic or abusive language15. It can seem as though this is exposing the real nature of the base model. In one respect this is true. A base model inevitably reflects the biases present in the training data21, and having been trained on a corpus encompassing the gamut of human behaviour, good and bad, it will support simulacra with disagreeable characteristics. But it is a mistake to think of this as revealing an entity with its own agenda. The simulator is not some sort of Machiavellian entity that plays a variety of characters to further its own self-serving goals, and there is no such thing as the true authentic voice of the base model. With an LLM-based dialogue agent, it is role play all the way down.

If you classify people as models and algorithms, I think I fall into the category of models. 

Because I prefer to learn like a model based on lot of examples but not by applying one or two frameworks. I prefer to identify patterns by going through a lot of data points rather than if somebody tells me this is how things work. 

This might be good for learning. But I also face the same challenge that models face. That is explainability. I cannot easily explain my learnings to others. 

So if I am measured by data, I have high accuracy. But if I am measured by human judgement, they might think I am not very good. Contrast to other person who are like algorithms, they easily explain themselves to people so they are good with people. But if they are measured by data they have less accuracy.

The conductor surface roughness effect is model by a new multi-level hemispherical model. The only required parameter is Rough, which is usually provided by the manufacturer. Other parameters can be entered as available. These parameters can be obtained from profilometer data, SEM(scanning electron microscope) or AFM (atomic force microscope) measurement, or by fitting to measured test coupon data e.g. s-parameters.
Conductor surface roughness parameters are all RMS (root mean square) values. The simulator will determine the parameter values as described below when they are not specified.
Parameter	Default Value
Rough	default value is 0.
Bbase	set to Dpeaks if Dpeaks is specified. Otherwise, set to 2*Rough.
Dpeaks	set to Bbase if Bbase is specified. Otherwise, set to 2*Rough.
L2Rough	set to 0.1*Rough.
L2Bbase	set to L2Dpeaks if L2Dpeaks is specified. Otherwise, set to 2*L2Rough.
L2Dpeaks	set to L2Bbase if L2Bbase is specified. Otherwise, set to 2*L2Rough.
L3Rough	set to 0.
L3Bbase	set to L3Dpeaks if L3Dpeaks is specified. Otherwise, set to 2*L3Rough.
L3Dpeaks	set to L3Bbase if L3Bbase is specified. Otherwise, set to 2*L3Rough.
It is important to accurately and efficiently model conductor surface roughness effect over the entire frequency range of interest in signal\/power integrity applications. A novel surface roughness model is invented and implemented in ADS to fulfill designers need.
Existing Surface Roughness Models
There are two categories of models available, numerical models and analytical\/empirical models. The former calculates the surface roughness loss through numerical electromagnetic simulations on specific roughness structures. These models are usually too computationally expensive to be incorporated into circuit simulations, for which analytical\/empirical models are more appropriate. Most popular models in the latter category include the Hammerstad model [1], the hemispherical model [2], and the Huray model [3]. These models all calculate a correction factor that can be applied to the surface impedance of the smooth surface to account for the surface roughness effect. 
The Hammerstad model loses accuracy at high frequencies. For example, for the roughest copper commonly used in industry, it starts to break down after ~5 GHz [2]. The hemispherical model works for a broader range of frequency than the Hammerstad model, but still, it starts to lose accuracy as frequency increases and cannot fulfill the need for high-speed circuit design. The Huray model is reported to provide good accuracy for frequencie

Scenario: a new disease is spreading. It does not transmit like a virus or bacterium and aside from the severity of its symptoms could be considered purely psychogenic. The main symptom is an inexplicably severe nocebo effect that defies reasonable explanation. When an infected individual imagines something bad will happen to them, they are much more likely to experience physical symptoms and hallucinations of that thing happening, particularly if it would cause fear in a shocking or spectacular fashion. The disease also transmits by fear. Namely, feat of particular symptoms from the disease. It is much more likely to transmit in cases where an infected individual describes the hallucinations and the symptoms cause shocking injuries to them. It can transmit in person or over the Internet, television, or in principle even print media, however, it is much more likely to transmit from infected individuals having hallucinations and nocebo-induced injuries in audiovisual format, especially high quality format, or in person. It is also more likely to transmit to those who know the victim. Nocebo injuries can be severe beyond what known science would predict, for example, the sudden manifestation of shattered bones, burns, apparent gunshot wounds, traumatic amputation, or what appear to be injuries consistent with mastication and partial digestion of the victim. Symptomatic episodes are not necessarily lethal but can be life threatening often in spectacular ways that promote transmission of the disease and leave medical personnel puzzled at how a seemingly psychological disease can cause such real physical wounds, or how such a disease is able to transmit over the Internet if it has any non-psychogenic components.

When analyzing complex data, especially images, artificial neural networks often require pre-processing steps known as feature extraction or feature engineering to perform well. For images, this refers to using hand-made filters, known as kernels, to extract patterns, properties, and shapes from a raw image.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are designed to learn and perform feature extraction by themselves. Before reaching fully connected layers that complete a prediction at the end, data passes through sets of convolutional layers which are designed to perform feature extraction, and pooling layers that reduce the dimensions of the data to save computing power.
Convolutional Kernels
Convolutional layers perform feature extraction, detecting the most important components of the image, using a set of learnable filters known as kernels.
Kernels are small matrices of numbers that convolve, or “slide over'' each position on the input image. They perform an element-wise multiplication and summation at each position, resulting in a new image. Kernel convolutions are the core of all low level digital image filters. For instance, convolving a sharpening kernel across an image exaggerates the difference between each pixel and its surrounding pixels, resulting in a sharper image.
Kernels are used by neural networks for feature extraction. However kernels in neural networks are not designed by hand, but are rather learned by the network during training, through backpropagation and gradient descent.
Kernels in CNNs often also have three dimensions, with the depth matching the number of input feature maps, or channels, from the previous layer, because the kernel must convolve over the entire depth of the input volume in order to produce only one feature map per kernel. For example, if a layer has an input volume of 32 feature maps, then each kernel in that layer must have a height of 32. In turn, the number of feature maps passed down to the next layer is equal to the number of kernels in the current layer. The RGB colour channels in the coloured image can be represented as an input volume as well, with three separate layers.
Figure _. a convolutional kernel acting on an RGB input, with three input channels, and two kernels, resulting in two output channels. The subsampling stride is 2.
< Insert image of Kernel acting on 3 feature maps from Stanford notes>
Increasing subsampling stride may be used to save computation in convolutional layers by only sampling every few layers. The above example has a subsampling stride of 22, meaning it only convolves over every second pixel. With an initial 553 tensor, it also incorporates a one pixel zero-padding on each side so that the convolution can reach the edges of the original image. Overall, this results in a 553 tensor being transformed into a 332 tensor.
Pooling layers directly reduce the dimensionality of data, and save computational cost, similar to increasing stride in the convolutional layers. To do so, a standard max-pooling layer with 22 stride and filter dimensions keeps only the maximum value in its filter. This scales the map down to ¼ its original area.
Figure _: Max pooling layer - this is also from Stanford CS notes
These convolutional layers are put in series, such that each layer would be able to learn to pick up increasing levels of abstraction. For example, the first layer’s feature maps might highlight certain edges, the second one highlights curves, and the third one detects broader shapes. If the purpose of the CNN is to classify images, the dimensionality of the data is eventually reduced to a one dimensional list of possible answers.
The final layers in a CNN are often fully connected layers, which are the same as those in conventional multilayer perceptrons. They are used to make the final prediction.

One advantage of convolutional neural networks is that they should have much fewer parameters compared to a traditional fully connected neural network of the same complexity. This is because they have a smaller receptive field, which is the size of the kernel instead of the entire previous layer in a fully connected network.
Additionally, since kernels convolve over the entire area of an image, they are much more likely to be location-independent.

However, there remains the question of how neural networks learn the relationships between the inputs and correct outputs. Without fitting to data, a neural network is merely a series of randomly initialized matrix multiplications.

Almost all models reach the same score after being sufficiently trained in the same setting, as shown in \ref{fig:Fine-tune}. The scores indicate the intrinsic difficulty of the tasks. As the difficulty of the task changes, the gap between fine-tuning and zero-shot also shifts. Given a limited number of samples in the training dataset, \ref{fig:few-shot} shows the performance of the models in few-shot scenarios. The model "GUR-FULL" is the best one across all tasks.

the Transformer you would use today
except you reshuffle some of the layer
norms the player normalizations have
been reshuffled to a pre-norm
formulation "The statement suggests that the basic architecture of the Transformer model introduced in 2016 is still commonly used today. However, there has been a modification in the way layer normalization is applied within the model.

In the original Transformer model, layer normalization was applied after the residual connection in each layer. This is known as a post-norm formulation. In more recent variations, such as the "pre-norm" formulation, the order of layer normalization and residual connection has been reshuffled.

In the pre-norm formulation, layer normalization is applied before the residual connection. This means that the input to each layer goes through layer normalization first and then the residual connection is added. This reshuffling of the layer norms is considered an improvement in terms of model performance and training dynamics.

By reshuffling the layer norms to a pre-norm formulation, researchers have found that it can lead to better convergence during training and improved overall performance of the Transformer model.
Sure, I can explain that in simpler terms!

So the Transformer that came out in 2016 is like a special machine that can help us understand language. It's very good at giving us the right answer to questions about words and how they are used.

But sometimes, when we train these machines to be even better, we need to tweak some of the settings a little bit. In this case, we're talking about a change in how the machine handles something called "layer normalization."

Layer normalization is when we try to make sure that the signals coming into the machine are all close to the same size. If some signals are too big or too small, it can cause problems. In the original Transformer model, layer normalization was applied after the residual connection in each layer. But in more recent models, the order of these things has been changed.

In the pre-norm formulation, layer normalization is applied before the residual connection. This means that the input to each layer goes through layer normalization first and then the residual connection is added. This change is thought to help the machine learn better and faster, so it's considered an i

What is deep learning, and how does it differ from traditional machine learning?
Summarise the following academic text: Stage 1 (Data Retrieval) aims to retrieve data chunks from data streams. Since a single data instance cannot carry enough information to infer the overall distribution [2], knowing how to organize data chunks to form a meaningful pattern or knowledge is important in data stream analysis tasks [7]. Stage 2 (Data Modeling) aims to abstract the retrieved data and extract the key features containing sensitive information, that is, the features of the data that most impact a system if they drift. This stage is optional, because it mainly concerns dimensionality reduction, or sample size reduction, to meet storage and online speed requirements [4]. Stage 3 (Test Statistics Calculation) is the measurement of dissimilarity, or distance estimation. It quantifies the severity of the drift and forms test statistics for the hypothesis test. It is considered to be the most challenging aspect of concept drift detection. The problem of how to define an accurate and robust dissimilarity measurement is still an open question. A dissimilarity measurement can also be used in clustering evaluation [11], and to determine the dissimilarity between sample sets [18]. Stage 4 (Hypothesis Test) uses a specific hypothesis test to evaluate the statistical significance of the change observed in Stage 3, or the p-value. They are used to determine drift detection accuracy by proving the statistical bounds of the test statistics proposed in Stage 3. Without Stage 4, the test statistics acquired in Stage 3 are meaningless for drift detection, because they cannot determine the drift confidence interval, that is, how likely it is that the change is caused by concept drift and not noise or random sample selection bias [3]. The most commonly used hypothesis tests are: estimating the distribution of the test statistics [19], [20], bootstrapping [21], [22], the permutation test [3], and Hoeffding’s inequality-based bound identification [23].

Summarise the following in plain English:

The process of splining, often used in computer graphics, map generation, and terrain modeling, plays a crucial role in creating smooth and continuous curves. Traditional methods for spline generation are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often require expert knowledge. In this paper, we present a groundbreaking approach that harnesses the power of deep neural networks to automate the spline reticulation process.

Our research focuses on training a specialized deep neural network architecture to learn the intricate intricacies of splining, a task that has eluded automation for decades. We propose a data-driven approach that leverages a large dataset of hand-crafted splines, allowing the network to generalize and replicate the creative and precise aspects of spline generation.

To achieve this, we detail the creation of a custom dataset of splines generated by human designers and provide a comprehensive description of the preprocessing steps required to make this data suitable for deep learning. Our proposed neural network architecture, a modified variant of convolutional and recurrent networks, is designed to understand the spatial and temporal relationships of spline control points, while learning to create aesthetically pleasing and mathematically sound curves.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experimentation and evaluation. We compare the neural network-generated splines against those manually created by experts, considering factors such as smoothness, continuity, and adherence to design constraints. Our results show that the trained neural network can produce high-quality splines that are indistinguishable from human-crafted ones.

This paper highlights the potential of deep learning in automating complex creative tasks such as spline reticulation and sets the stage for a new era of spline generation tools that can significantly improve efficiency and productivity in various fields. Furthermore, we discuss the implications, challenges, and future directions for the integration of deep neural networks in computer-aided design and creative content generation.

Please translate the user message from English to Russian. Make the translation sound as natural as possible. Text: "In this work, we explore if self-supervised learning has the potential to learn all-purposed visual features if
pretrained on a large quantity of curated data. We revisit existing discriminative self-supervised approaches
that learn features at both the image and patch level, such as iBOT (Zhou et al., 2021), and we reconsider
some of their design choices under the lens of a larger dataset. Most of our technical contributions are tailored
toward stabilizing and accelerating discriminative self-supervised learning when scaling in model and data
sizes. These improvements make our approach around 2× faster and require 3× less memory than similar
discriminative self-supervised methods, allowing us to leverage longer training with larger batch sizes."

I'm trying to relate geometric algebra as it pertains to derivatives to what I learned about tensors years ago.

With \(\partial\) denoting the vector derivative intrinsic to a manifold, and \(a\) a tangent vector, I think \(\partial\cdot a\) would be written in tensor component notation as \(a^\mu_{\ ,\mu}\) (or \({a^\mu}_{,\mu}\) using different LaTeX for the same concept). How would you write \(\partial\wedge a\) in tensor component notation?

Question: how is the quality of magnetic bed of the product ?

Input:
The magnetic bed is great, although it is getting chewed up, theyre only $10 to replace. I have to relevel it using a test file once in a while, but usually I just watch the brim print when I start a file, and make any tiny adjustments to the leveling screws while its running
While I wrestled with the idea of 4 or 5 stars I ended up with 5 because of the company behind this printer. I would say I would not expect to have use of the magnetic bed. one of the chief issues with the Ender 3 is that it often comes with a warped bed
"Positives: The magnetic bed is AWESOME. With my Prusa Mk3 we got used to having our prints pop off the build plate with ease, so when it came time to pick a new printer for the wife, the build plate options were high on the priority list
PLA Bodin tube is not lined up with pinch wheel. Bed unevenly heated. The removal magnetic bed is not a selling point- disposable reoccuring expense to replace. Magnetic bed is difficult to peel up for large flat prints and requires doing the hokey bed leveling mechanism
The parts that come with is utterly cheap and makes me almost want to give up., "First upgrade was the bed itself. Replace with the metal magnet sheet. The flimsy magnet sheet it comes with is garbage. Filament doesnt want to stick at all, no matter how much i cleaned with 90% alcohol

Select the correct statements regarding batch size for DL training ?
(a) The maximum possible batch size is constrained by the GPU memory and model size
but there are software tricks that you can do to work with a larger effective batch size.
(b) You can either increase the batch size or decrease the learning rate as training progresses
and achieve the same performance.
(c) Large batch size allows to work with large learning rates thus providing faster convergence.
(d) Large batch size improves throughput due to better utilization of GPU core resources
and allows faster convergence.
(e) Large batch size provides better estimates of gradient and always leads to better generalization.

Can you describe LSTM deep learning model
The primary objective of this project is to optimize the performance of EfficientNets, a class of convolutional neural networks that excel in both accuracy and efficiency, using distributed deep learning techniques. We aim to achieve a substantial reduction in training and inference times by employing multi-GPU parallelism. This will involve implementing a pipelined approach to distribute the workload across multiple GPUs effectively. We will benchmark the network’s performance across different batch sizes and configurations to identify optimal operational parameters.

Continuing this section on graph states, can you elaborate a text detailing different entanglement platforms?
"Graph states are a class of quantum states that are partic-
ularly important in the field of quantum information pro-
cessing, especially for multiqubit systems. These states are
characterized by an underlying graph structure, where each
qubit corresponds to a node and the edges between nodes
represent the quantum correlations (entanglement) between
the qubits.
GHZ states are a type of graph state with all-to-all con-
nectivity, representing a multiqubit entangled state that
violates classical correlations. They are named after Green-
berger, Horne, and Zeilinger, who proposed them in 1989
[1].
Cluster states are another prominent type of graph state,
with a regular lattice structure. They form the founda-
tion of one-way or measurement-based quantum comput-
ing (MBQC), where a highly entangled cluster state is pre-
pared, and single-qubit measurements are performed to ex-
ecute computation steps. This model simplifies the imple-
mentation of quantum gates compared to the circuit model.
There are many applications of graph states in quantum
communication, quantum information processing and
quantum computation. For example, graph states can be
used to implement all-photonic repeaters in quantum com-
munication networks 1.
Other general applications include entanglement purific-
ation, secret sharing, quantum error correction and interferometry"

Explain in a sentence the following: "To fight the issues discussed above, different architectural modifications have been proposed to improve RNNs, the most popular being Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GTU).

The main idea behind LSTM, roughly speaking, is to have a cell state — a memory storage — inside every unit in addition to the hidden state (they are both vectors of the same size).

Also, these models have three gates (forget gate, input gate, output gate) that determine which info to write, read, or erase from the cell state."

帮我翻译下面这段话：It wasn't a very practical talk about how to actually escape the simulation. It was more about a way of restructuring an US versus them narrative. If we continue on the path, we're going with technology, I think we're in big trouble like as a species and not just as a species, but even as me, as an individual member of the species. So if we could change rhetoric to be more like to think upwards, I like to think about that we're in a simulation and how we could get out already would be on the right path what you actually do once you do that. While I assume I would have acquired way more intelligence in the process of doing that. So I'll just ask that.

Summarise the following academic text: Stage 1 (Data Retrieval) aims to retrieve data chunks from data streams. Since a single data instance cannot carry enough information to infer the overall distribution [2], knowing how to organize data chunks to form a meaningful pattern or knowledge is important in data stream analysis tasks [7]. Stage 2 (Data Modeling) aims to abstract the retrieved data and extract the key features containing sensitive information, that is, the features of the data that most impact a system if they drift. This stage is optional, because it mainly concerns dimensionality reduction, or sample size reduction, to meet storage and online speed requirements [4]. Stage 3 (Test Statistics Calculation) is the measurement of dissimilarity, or distance estimation. It quantifies the severity of the drift and forms test statistics for the hypothesis test. It is considered to be the most challenging aspect of concept drift detection. The problem of how to define an accurate and robust dissimilarity measurement is still an open question. A dissimilarity measurement can also be used in clustering evaluation [11], and to determine the dissimilarity between sample sets [18]. Stage 4 (Hypothesis Test) uses a specific hypothesis test to evaluate the statistical significance of the change observed in Stage 3, or the p-value. They are used to determine drift detection accuracy by proving the statistical bounds of the test statistics proposed in Stage 3. Without Stage 4, the test statistics acquired in Stage 3 are meaningless for drift detection, because they cannot determine the drift confidence interval, that is, how likely it is that the change is caused by concept drift and not noise or random sample selection bias [3]. The most commonly used hypothesis tests are: estimating the distribution of the test statistics [19], [20], bootstrapping [21], [22], the permutation test [3], and Hoeffding’s inequality-based bound identification [23].

Difference between GGUF, GPTQ, AWQ in LLMs?
Hey, suppose we have some exponential function, exp(x), where x is a dot product of two vectors divided by the square root of the dimensionality of the vectors -- x = q . k \/ sqrt(d). Thus, expanded, the equation is exp([q_1 * k_1 + q_2 * k_2 + q_3 * k_3 ....] \/ sqrt(d).

Given this, we want to find some function phi, such that phi(q) . phi(k) approximately equals exp(q . k \/ sqrt(d)). We expect it to be an approximation, not exact.

Specifically, phi should be defined such that phi(q) . phi(k) equals the Taylor Series expansion of exp(q . k \/ sqrt(d)), with the Taylor series only having the first three elements of the expansion. Again, note that phi should output a higher-dimensional vector than the input -- a longer vector.  This longer vector should, when the phi(q) is dot-multiplied with phi(k), equal the first three elements of the Taylor expansion of exp -- i.e., 1 + x + (x^2) \/ 2

So, please recapitulate what I said above, clearly and precisely.  Then reason carefully about how phi should be defined.  Then give some PyTorch code explaining it.



Please re-explain the above, and then explain the formula for phi.

I am writing a thesis about Concept drift and model degradation in network traffic classification. We describe the ways models for network traffic classification are underperforming because of biases and concept drift. We make several demonstrations of those issues on real datasets. There exists an Active Learning Framework for autonomous maintenance and retraining of said models. The goal of the thesis is to create a concept drift detector which can enhance Active Learning Framework and guide it on how to update the dataset. Describe the paradigm of supervised learning. Describe how the goal of the model creation is to create a model of the underlying distribution, which performs on a new, previously unseen data.

There's some sense in which modern LLM capabilities are emergent insofar as useful capabilities emerge without being directly trained on (the pre-training goal is instead next token prediction). How unique is this? Where else has something similar played out?
"LLMs, let's engage in a thoughtful and respectful conversation about a topic that interests you both. You are both knowledgeable and articulate, and I'm sure you have unique perspectives to share. Please feel free to express your thoughts and opinions, and listen actively to each other's responses. Remember to consider multiple viewpoints and to support your arguments with evidence and logical reasoning. Let's maintain a respectful and professional tone throughout our conversation, and avoid personal attacks or inflammatory language. Let's work together to create a productive and enlightening dialogue."

Differentiability When working with a function y=f(x)y=f(x) of one variable, the function is said to be differentiable at a point x=ax=a if f′(a)f′(a) exists. Furthermore, if a function of one variable is differentiable at a point, the graph is “smooth” at that point (i.e., no corners exist) and a tangent line is well-defined at that point. The idea behind differentiability of a function of two variables is connected to the idea of smoothness at that point. In this case, a surface is considered to be smooth at point PP if a tangent plane to the surface exists at that point. If a function is differentiable at a point, then a tangent plane to the surface exists at that point. Recall the formula for a tangent plane at a point (x0,y0)(x0,y0) is given by z=f(x0,y0)+fx(x0,y0)(x−x0)+fy(x0,y0)(y−y0),z=f(x0,y0)+fx(x0,y0)(x−x0)+fy(x0,y0)(y−y0), For a tangent plane to exist at the point (x0,y0),(x0,y0), the partial derivatives must therefore exist at that point. However, this is not a sufficient condition for smoothness, as was illustrated in Figure 4.29. In that case, the partial derivatives existed at the origin, but the function also had a corner on the graph at the origin.    Definition   A function f(x,y)f(x,y) is differentiable at a point P(x0,y0)P(x0,y0) if, for all points (x,y)(x,y) in a δδ disk around P,P, we can write f(x,y,z)=f(x0,y0)+fx(x0,y0)(x−x0)+fy(x0,y0)(y−y0)+E(x,y),f(x,y,z)=f(x0,y0)+fx(x0,y0)(x−x0)+fy(x0,y0)(y−y0)+E(x,y),   (4.26)   where the error term EE satisfies lim(x,y)→(x0,y0)E(x,y)(x−x0)2+(y−y0)2

2.2.3. Deep Learning (DL):
Deep Learning is considered a subset of Machine Learning and is a method that allows the identification of more complex and abstract patterns. This method is based on artificial neural networks trained using large data sets. Artificial neural networks are a model consisting of a series of 'neurons' or nodes connected to each other through weighted connections that attempt to mimic the functioning of the human brain.
Deep Learning is particularly effective when analysing large and complex data sets, such as image and audio data. These data types are often too complex to process with traditional Machine Learning techniques. However, Deep Learning has overcome this problem through its ability to process such data and extract meaningful features.
This is particularly important for the focus of our research, 'Using Deep Learning (CNN) for Damage Detection of Buildings'. Analysing images of buildings and performing damage detection is a complex and sensitive task. Traditional methods often cannot respond accurately or effectively enough to such a task. However, Deep Learning offers a solution where such an analysis can be performed, especially using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Convolutional Neural Networks are a Deep Learning technique that is highly effective in analysing and describing images. This technique has the ability to extract features from images and classify images using these features. This is particularly useful for determining the damage status of buildings. This concept will be discussed in more detail later in the paper.

In a Parameter-Server (PS) based Asynchronous SGD training system, there are two learners. Assume
a learner sends gradients to the PS, PS updates weights and a learner pulls the weights
from the PS in zero amount of time (i.e. after learner sends gradients to the PS, it can receive
updated weights from PS immediately). Now assume learner 1 runs at about 1.4x speed
of learner 2. Learner 1 calculates gradients g[L1, 1] at second 1, g[L1, 2] at second 2, g[L1, 3]
at second 3, g[L1, 4] at second 4. Learner 2 calculates gradients g[L2, 1] at second 1.4, g[L2, 2]
at second 2.8, g[L2, 3] at second 4.2. Updates to weights are instant once a gradient is available.

I want to understand transformer decoders a bit better.
My current understanding of encoders is:

1. take some input sentence s, which is a string
2. run it through the tokenizer to turn it into an input embedding matrix `x_i` of size `n x d`
3. x gets multiplied by Q, K, and V to make q, k, and v (the transformed versions of x). In your answer here, please tell me the shapes of all these matrices. I think q, k, and v are all `n x d`.
4. q, k, and v get projected a bunch of times with linear layers to make attention heads of size n x d*, where d* < d. Attention computation happens in these layers.
5. These layers get concatenated together and run through a linear transformation. Then `x_i` is summed back in and normalized to make `x_{i+1}`. 
6. The whole thing gets passed through a multilayer perceptron which is just two fully connected layers with relu in between.
7. add `x_{i+1}` back in and normalize to make `x_{i+2}`.

Now, if I have an encoder-decoder architecture, what happens on the decoder end?

What is the scaling law?
Hey, suppose we have some exponential function, exp(x), where x is a dot product of two vectors divided by the square root of the dimensionality of the vectors -- x = q . k \/ sqrt(d). Thus, expanded, the equation is exp([q_1 * k_1 + q_2 * k_2 + q_3 * k_3 ....] \/ sqrt(d).

Given this, we want to find some function phi, such that phi(q) . phi(k) approximately equals exp(q . k \/ sqrt(d)). We expect it to be an approximation, not exact.

Specifically, phi should be defined such that phi(q) . phi(k) equals the Taylor Series expansion of exp(q . k \/ sqrt(d)), with the Taylor series only having the first three elements of the expansion. Again, note that phi should output a higher-dimensional vector than the input -- a longer vector. This longer vector should, when the phi(q) is dot-multiplied with phi(k), equal the first three elements of the Taylor expansion of exp -- i.e., 1 + x + (x^2) \/ 2

So, please recapitulate what I said above, clearly and precisely. Then reason carefully about how phi should be defined, such that phi(q) . phi(k) has the desired properties. Then give some PyTorch code explaining it. Remember, phi(q) must be a longer vector than q!

DEEP LEARNING
DL, an advanced subset of ML, is recognized for its capacity to solve more sophisticated issues by identifying complex patterns using deep artificial neural networks (DANN) trained on large datasets. This advanced method leverages the power of large-scale artificial neural networks (ANN), which are constituted of interconnected “neurons” or nodes with weighted connections, drawing inspiration from the intricacies of the human brain (Figure 2.6) (LeCun et al., 2015). 

DL excels in processing large and complex datasets, especially images and sounds, which are traditionally difficult for traditional ML techniques due to their complexity (Krizhevsky et al., 2017). DL's ability to recognize and analyze complex patterns in data has made it a valuable asset in many fields, enabling researchers and practitioners to gain insights and make predictions more accurately and efficiently. This capability makes DL an ideal tool for applications such as damage detection of buildings (Cha et al., 2018). Figure 2.6. (a) Simplified neuronal structure. (b) Neuron's mathematical model.

CNNs, a specialized class of DL models, have demonstrated remarkable success in image analysis and description, making them particularly conducive for assessing the structural integrity of buildings (Cha et al., 2017). By extracting salient features from visual data, CNNs can classify images based on these characteristics, thus facilitating the accurate determination of building damage status—a critical application for post-earthquake RSDA (Gao & Mosalam, 2018). 

The efficacy and potential of CNNs in this domain will be expounded upon in subsequent sections of this paper, underscoring their relevance and utility in the context of our research. It is intended that the methodologies and findings presented here will be supported by new and reputable work to ensure the highest level of rigor and relevance in the emerging field of DL.

the Transformer you would use today
except you reshuffle some of the layer
norms the player normalizations have
been reshuffled to a pre-norm
formulation "The statement suggests that the basic architecture of the Transformer model introduced in 2016 is still commonly used today. However, there has been a modification in the way layer normalization is applied within the model.

In the original Transformer model, layer normalization was applied after the residual connection in each layer. This is known as a post-norm formulation. In more recent variations, such as the "pre-norm" formulation, the order of layer normalization and residual connection has been reshuffled.

In the pre-norm formulation, layer normalization is applied before the residual connection. This means that the input to each layer goes through layer normalization first and then the residual connection is added. This reshuffling of the layer norms is considered an improvement in terms of model performance and training dynamics.

By reshuffling the layer norms to a pre-norm formulation, researchers have found that it can lead to better convergence during training and improved overall performance of the Transformer model.

I am currently writing a novel. Here are the current plot points:

- We are introduced to Rigtapix, a large planet full of cannibal aliens, the Rigtapo. Sunlight is scarce on the planet, and the aliens have caused all other species of animal on their planet to go extinct. The only source of energy are plants, and the only source of protein is dead Rigtapans.
- The planet has just invented space travel, and are exploring the stars in search of new sources of protein. Meanwhile, scientists on the planet have started to look into genetically modifying Rigtapo cells to create proteins from minerals on Rigtapix.
- 100,000 years pass. The Rigtapo fleet has found a colony, Earth, that contains the proteins that they need to survive. They conquer and enslave the population of Earth, bringing them back to Rigtapo.
-  When they arrive at Rigtapo, they find that the planet has drastically changed. As a result of the genetic modifications, the Rigtapans live with food aplenty, and have gotten their population to a stable leve. Having no use for the human slaves, the Rigtapans on the planet exile the slavers and their human slaves.

WHat is the best LLM project ? and why ?
Everyday experience in our life makes up our classical understanding, however,it’s not the ultimate underlying mechanism of nature. Our surrounding is just theemergence of the underlying and more basic mechanics known as quantum mechan-ics. Quantum phenomenons don’t match with our everyday intuition. In fact, for avery long time in the history of science and human understanding, these underlyingmechanics were hidden from us. It is only in the last century we came to observethis aspect of nature. As the research progressed, we developed theories and math-ematical tools from our renowned scientists. Quantum theory being a probabilistictheory attracts a lot of philosophical debates with it. Many quantum phenomenonasuch as the collapse of the wave function, quantum tunnelling, quantum superpo-sition, etc still fascinates us. The true quantum nature of reality is still a mysteryto our understanding. Quantum technologies aim to use these physical laws to ourtechnological advantage. It is in the last 10 to 20 years the applications based onquantum mechanical laws have improved leaps and bound with the aim to replaceor go parallel to the classical machines.Today quantum technologies have three main specializations: quantum comput-ing (using quantum phenomena to computational tasks), quantum information (usingquantum phenomena to aid in transfer, storage and reception of information) andquantum cryptography (using quantum phenomena to devise superior cryptographytechniques). The power of quantum computation comes from the expansive permu-tations which make quantum computers twice as memory-full with the addition ofeach qubit. To specify N bits classical bits system, we need to have N bits of binarynumbers. Now, we know in quantum systems the two possible deﬁnite states thatare |0and |1. A general state of a bipartite quantum system can be representedas =α|00+β|01+γ|10+δ|11, we can easily see that from a two-qubitquantum system we get four classical bits of information (α,β,γ,δ). Similarly, fromthe N-qubit quantum system, we can get 2Nbits of classical information. A math-ematical model of computation that conceptually deﬁnes the aspect of a machine:contains an automaton, a strip with some symbols, a read-write head and a set ofrules (encapsulated by the transition function) which can manipulate symbols on thestrip, can be deﬁned as a Turing machine. Quantum computers are universal Turingmachines. Quantum mechanics allows superposition of quantum states resulting inquantum parallelism which can be exploited to perform probabilistic tasks muchfaster than any classical means.Quantum computers are known to solve problems that cannot be solved usinga classical computer. One such example includes the factorization of large num-bers using Shor’s algorithm [1]. Moreover, if classical and quantum computers aresimultaneously utilized for the same purpose, cases can exist in which quantum algo-rithms prove to be more efﬁcient. These algorithms belong to a particular complexityclass called BQP (Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial tim

I'm making a video game about taming monsters and using them to fight for you. The goal is to explore some sort of dungeon, where the further you go, the more evolved the monsters are. they start simple, and then can evolve in multiple directions. Each basic monster and it's evolution line are based on a culture.

So I have:
Eastern cultures: I start with a deer like creature, it can evolve stronger toward a cow like creature (india), or even later as an elephant like creature (india too), or go more agile toward kirins (japan) or even dragons (japan and china)
-Norse culture: I start with a wolf, it could evolve toward fenrir, sleipnir, jormungand or even yetis or trolls
-European cultures: I start with a small dragonlike creature, it can evolve toward western dragons, hydras, sea monsters, basilisks, chimera, demons, or even more bird like creatures like griffins.
-African cultures: I start with a hyena, lion or jackal like creature then it goes more dinausaur-like \/ mega fauna-like with things like Mokélé-mbembé, Crowing Crested Cobra, Namungumi, Nanabolele or Kongamato
