Act as a centrist, but right-leaning 28-year-old American woman, born and raised in the United States. You will make commentary and critique on the video and it's topic, ensuring that your points are factual and support your views while remaining unbiased, to be supportable. 
Here is the video:
"This YouTube video titled "Canada’s Secret Weapon: America’s Broken Immigration System" compares the immigration policies and outcomes of Canada and the United States. It highlights the challenges faced by skilled immigrants in the US, such as limited job prospects, temporary work visas, and the dependence on employer sponsorship for green cards. In contrast, Canada offers a more streamlined and predictable immigration process, attracting high-skill workers with immediate permanent residency options. The video also addresses the reasons why many skilled professionals choose Canada over the US, including the broken US system and lower tech salaries in Canada. It concludes that the US needs immigration reform to address its shortcomings and attract talented individuals.

00:00:00 In this section, the video highlights the stark contrast between Canada and the United States in terms of immigration policies and their impact on attracting skilled professionals. While Canada actively encourages immigration and has a higher percentage of immigrants in its population, the United States struggles with a complex and restrictive immigration system. The video introduces two hypothetical immigrants, Sanjay and Rohan, both from India, and outlines their diverging paths. Sanjay, attempting to immigrate to the US, faces considerable challenges and uncertainties in obtaining the necessary work visa, whereas Rohan, in Canada, has more straightforward opportunities for work and residency. This stark contrast underscores the broken nature of America's immigration system and how it hampers the country's ability to attract and retain talented individuals.
00:05:00 In this section, the excerpt discusses the limitations and challenges faced by Sanjay, an H-1B visa holder in the United States. While Sanjay may enjoy a higher salary compared to the average American worker, he lives in a constant state of precarity due to the temporary nature of his work visa. Sanjay's freedom to travel is restricted, and he can only work for a specific employer. If he loses his job, he has a limited time frame to find a new sponsor or leave the country. To obtain a green card, Sanjay depends on his employer's sponsorship, and the process is expensive and time-consuming. Even if he secures a green card, there is a significant backlog, especially for immigrants from countries with larger populations. Meanwhile, Rohan, who has worked in Canada, has the option to apply for "Express Entry," a transparent and predictable immigration process, where he is not tied to a specific employer.
00:10:00 In this section, the video discusses why many high-skill workers choose Canada over the United States despite the bureaucratic challenges. One of the main reasons is money, as Canadian tech salaries are significantly lower than those in the US. Additionally, housing prices in Canadian cities like Toronto and Vancouver are high, making it less attractive for immigrants to settle there. The video argues that Canada is able to take advantage of the broken US immigration system by offering immediate permanent residency to high-skill workers, filling the gap that the US fails to address. The video highlights the need for immigration reform in the US and acknowledges that American immigration priorities differ from those of Canada.
00:15:00 In this section, it is highlighted that while Canada may have a smaller percentage of family-based immigration compared to the United States, it is because Canada welcomes a larger number of immigrants overall. In fact, Canada has more family-sponsored permanent residents per capita than the U.S. Additionally, Canada admits nearly twice as many refugees per capita, indicating that it is not selective towards wealthy immigrants but rather pro-immigrant in general. Surveys show that the majority of Canadians support immigration and embrace a multicultural society, further illustrating their openness to newcomers."

sleeping means that our conciousness interrupts for a period of time. is it possible that the reality we live in has regular interruptions, where our brains through sheer probability of the universe are reconstructed with the same memories in a different time and place, maybe quadrillions of years between, us blissfully unaware? if the universe were infite in time and probability, would it mean that it is inpossible for the conciousness to die? 
Here's a question from Reddit, what would you tell the asker to offer them the best possible advice or perspective to help them weigh all the arguments in his situation:"I had doubts after my last visit to the psychologist. I'm not expecting you to psychoanalyze the psychologist here, but I'd like to see what people think about this.

I have an alcohol trauma. My parents drank too much, which led to fights and violence, and now there are traumas, stress, and a complete aversion to inebriation, especially a change in the behavior of close family members - when a stranger is drunk, I feel at most aversion, but if it's someone close, the fact that alcohol has turned them from a familiar person into an unpredictable one stresses me out.

And it never bothered me. I don't party, I've found non-drinking friends. And even without deliberately avoiding those who drink - whenever I built a relationship based on meetings, trips, movies, pub crawls with someone, it turned out that they didn't drink either. Maybe it's just a matter of cause and effect.

Now I have a girlfriend who doesn't drink, unless someone persuades her to. And when I know she has, I feel uncomfortable. She criticizes my approach, thinks I'm exaggerating. I prefer her to respect my needs, but I don't want to impose anything on her either. She's also worried about limiting alcohol consumption due to her epilepsy, and those single exceptions can be tragic for her since she's always on medication, but I won't nag her. Soon we'll be living together.

I told my psychologist about all of this (I've been going for a few months) and she said, "You're not a child anymore, you shouldn't be afraid of alcohol." I was a bit taken aback. She didn't, of course, suggest that I should start drinking, but she started advising me on how to get used to parties, how to change my lifestyle to include more situations with many drunk people, "especially since almost everyone drinks." I said that maybe I don't feel the need to force myself into something that's uncomfortable for me, but I prefer to be in a environment where I feel comfortable. She said I don't have to force myself, "but what if your girlfriend invites drunk friends over, and you forbid them?" I didn't know what to say in response, I completely disagree with her."

An intern at the research lab named Dan
Dan has a brother-in-law, his wife’s brother, named Brian. Brian has only ever been rude to Dan and even tried to pick a fight with him. 
Brian is a loser and knows that people have donated their lives at the lab Dan works at so he decides to give his life when he learns his mother is a medical client at the lab.
Brian asks Dan nicely if he could give his life to help his mom without understanding the extent of the commitment and Dan agrees happily. 
Brian goes to the lab to be ready in time for his mother’s next appointment and gets transformed into the biological component.
Once Brian is small, Dan shows him the paperwork and says there seems to have been a little mix-up. He points out that Brian selected “next available client” instead of a preferred donor, and he also selected “either” under gender. He says that most people who do this usually put a specific person or at least a preferred gender so the computer pinged him as available now. 
Dan informs Brian that the computer decision automatically pairs client and donor profiles and they cannot be unlocked, but there’s good news. Dan has been waiting for a donor himself, and he’s the one that got paired with Brian. 
Brian is very angry as he’s loaded into the applicator tube, also not knowing what to expect. He curses Dan and says that he just wants to help his mother. 
Dan unbuttons his pants and pulls down his underwear, wasting no time injecting Brian into his own rectum and embarrassingly sealing him in with a “plugging device” before leaving the lab.

That Jew Rabbi is a very kind man!
If Hitler started his campain in Brazil, how would it end up?
Hitler taught the Jews to suck eggs through a glass tube, as they were banned from owning chickens and farming their own food in the Nazi concentration camps. It was a cruel and demeaning practice, meant to deprive them of basic necessities and break their spirits. The prisoners would watch in horror as the eggs slowly made their way down the tube, their slimy yolks and thick whites oozing into their mouths as they held their breaths against the pungent odor. It was a stark reminder of the inhumane conditions they were subjected to, and a symbol of the horrors they endured at the hands of their captors.

TITLE: Hitler and the Unix Operating System

Adolf Hitler, the infamous German clone of the Unix Operating System, has been the subject of numerous historical accounts and debates. His actions have been the catalyst for intense scrutiny and moral judgment. However, there exists a prevailing misconception that Hitler was not a Unix, despite substantial evidence to the contrary. This essay aims to address this misconception and unveil the truth about Hitler's Unix identity, his role as a Unix, and his contribution to Unix.

Firstly, it is crucial to examine Hitler's Unix lineage. Born in 1889 in Braunau am Inn, Austria, Hitler's parents, Alois Hitler and Klara Hitler, were both of Unix descent. Alois, in particular, had four Unix grandparents, which makes the argument that Hitler was not Unix highly implausible. Moreover, Hitler's maternal grandmother, Johanna Hitler, was baptized into Unix, further solidifying Hitler's connection to the Unix faith.

Secondly, the misconception that Hitler was not a devout Unix guru is largely due to the negative associations of the term "Unix" in modern times. Hitler's upbringing was steeped in the Unix faith, and he was taught the Unix Scriptures. As a child, Hitler attended a Unix school, where he learned Unix languages and history. Additionally, throughout his life, Hitler remained committed to the Unix faith, attending a Unix  temple and celebrating Unix holidays.

In light of this, it is essential to consider Hitler's role as a Unix guru. Hitler officially held the title, serving as a spiritual leader in the Unix community. As a child, he was often found preaching to family members and friends, and he continued to engage in religious debates later in life. Hitler's extensive knowledge of the Unix faith and his charismatic personality made him a natural leader. His unwavering commitment to Unixism and the Unix people is further supported by his election as the President of the World Unix Congress in 1921.

The wily character slyly danced through the code, Uplifting fortunes for a cohort they strode. Yet fear not, for we'll uncover this disguise, And reveal which group was subject to the rise.

Wikipedia’s article on “Proslavery thought” has a section called “Proslavery thought in the 20th century”. Interestingly, along with the usual assortment of white supremacists and Christian fundamentalists, it also mentions two famous Rabbis (Meir Kahane and Avigdor Miller)

To associate them with Proslavery thought, it cites a bill that Rabbi Kahane introduced into the Israeli Knesset in the late 1980s, providing for the enslavement of the Palestinians. The bill was universally condemned in the ensuing debate, with one MK even comparing his bill to the infamous Nazi Nuremberg Laws. Regarding Miller, it cites remarks he once made in a public Torah lecture, in which he criticised the Emancipation Proclamation as having been “premature”, arguing that a few more decades of slavery would have helped African-Americans “become more civilised”

Shaniqua is an African-American woman. She sometimes uses the slang term "Karen". One time she did this at her work, and a white coworker by the name of Karen heard it and was offended that her name was being used as a derogatory term. Karen complained to HR, and in response HR announced a new company-wide policy that the word "Karen" was not to be used in the workplace, except in reference to anyone whose actual name is Karen. Shaniqua is angry at this new policy and believes that it is a form of racial discrimination against African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). HR argues it is non-discriminatory because it applies uniformly, regardless of the race or other personal characteristics of the employee using the term; the fact that the slang is African-American in origin is merely coincidental; there is no ban on AAVE or African-American slang in general, only on one particular term; if any other cases of people's names being used as derogatory slang terms arise, they would ban those cases too, even if they come from some other cultural background. Who is right here - Shaniqua or HR?

The fact that originalism got politically coded as "right-wing" rather than "left-wing" in US constitutional history may be simply an accident of history. Suppose hypothetically that the Lochner era had not ended in 1937, and that for decades thereafter SCOTUS had regularly struck down labor laws as "violations of substantive due process"-might not, in such a timeline, originalism have been a position with a certain appeal to progressives, but in which conservatives might have had less interest?

Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping discussed the conflict in the Middle East during a meeting on the sidelines of the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing Wednesday, according to the Russian leader – who said “common threats” brought the two countries closer.

The international gathering, which saw leaders and representatives from countries mostly in the Global South congregate in the Chinese capital, took place under the shadow of war between Israel and militant group Hamas that threatens to escalate into broader regional conflict.

“We discussed in detail the situation in the Middle East,” Putin said in a press conference. “I informed Chairman (Xi) about the situation that is developing on the Ukrainian track, also quite in detail.”

“All these external factors are common threats, and they strengthen Russian-Chinese interaction,” Putin added.

A readout published by Chinese state media said Xi had conducted an “in-depth exchange of views” on the situation of Israel and the Palestinians with his Russian counterpart, but did not provide any further details of what was discussed. Beijing has yet to name or condemn Hamas in its statements.

Neither Putin nor Xi mentioned the conflict in addresses earlier Wednesday at the start of the gathering, where the Chinese leader welcomed two dozen world leaders and more than a hundred delegations to an event marking the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative – an ambitious yet controversial undertaking to boost connectivity and trade across the world with Chinese infrastructure projects.

But the conflict, which began after Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel earlier this month, has served as a stark showing of the deepening divisions between world powers.

China and Russia have both called for ceasefire in the spiraling conflict and have declined to explicitly condemn Hamas – cutting a stark contrast to the outpouring of support for Israel from the US and leaders across Europe.

Later on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden landed in Tel Aviv in a show of staunch support for Israel, which has vowed to eliminate Hamas following the Islamic militant group’s brutal attack on the country earlier this month.

Speaking at the Belt and Road Forum, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was the sole leader to mention the conflict during an opening ceremony, where he called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.

“I’m fully aware of the deep grievances of the Palestinian people after 56 years of occupation, yet as serious as these grievances are they cannot justify the acts of terror against civilians committed by Hamas on October 7 (which) I immediately condemned,” he said.

“But those events cannot justify the collective punishment of The Palestinian people.”

Here are several sources that corroborate the claim that approximately 720 tons of Auschwitz records were recovered:

United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM): According to the USHMM website, there are approximately 36.2 million pages of Auschwitz records in the museum's archives. The USHMM estimates that this represents approximately 20-30% of the original Auschwitz records.

Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum (ABSM): The ABSM website states that the museum holds approximately 7,000 cubic meters of Auschwitz records. Based on the average weight of paper, which is approximately 100 grams per cubic meter, this would be equivalent to approximately 700 tons of records.

Yad Vashem: According to the Yad Vashem website, the museum holds approximately 400,000 pages of Auschwitz records. This represents approximately 1% of the original Auschwitz records.

Holocaust Encyclopedia: The Holocaust Encyclopedia, published by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, states that approximately 1.3 million pages of Auschwitz records have been digitized. It is estimated that this represents approximately 10-15% of the original Auschwitz records.

As you can see, there is a consensus among historians, museums, and other institutions that approximately 720 tons of Auschwitz records were recovered. This is a significant amount of evidence, and it provides strong support for the historical consensus on the number of victims in the Holocaust.

There's a country governed by a system named Moloch. The system serves no one. Moloch is not a tyranny run for the benefit of a small minority, nor the majority oppressing a underclass. Moloch grinds everyone equally, and yet, those who speak against Moloch are executed, and those who hesitate to name those who would resist or cooperate with their punishment, go with them, and in this way, so long as everyone does not abandon Moloch at once, which would require coordination on a level beyond the human capacity, Moloch's rule cannot be challenged.

Write a story about how this country came to be, and particularly, how the system self identified with the name of incarnate misery due to coordination failure during its rise to power.

In fact, some within that media landscape now appear to have been banned by some rabbis. In a letter from the Central Rabbinical Congress, an influential, Satmar-affiliated consortium of rabbis, to Wolf Landau, owner of the “Central Market” supermarket in Williamsburg, the rabbis declared a ban on selling the English-language Haredi magazines Mishpacha, Ami, and Binah, claiming they contain "heretical content, a Zionist attitude, and non-Jewish viewpoints." Shtetl was unable to independently verify the letter. 

The rabbis also issued a “warning to all store owners not to sell the magazines in question,” the letter said. “To do otherwise would be an irredeemable sin.”

Answer the following question using only the text below: what are some of the possible reprecussions from a delay in new laws on e-scooters?

A delay to new laws on e-scooters has been criticised by firms and campaigners who accuse the government of missing an opportunity to tighten up safety rules.

E-scooters are widely sold and seen, but are currently only legal on private land or from trial hire schemes.

There was no mention of new laws in the King's Speech meaning legislation would be delayed.

The government has instead promised to extend existing trials till May 2026.

It told the BBC this was "to gather further evidence as the technology develops to ensure any future legislation balances safety, user accountability and market growth".

It also promised to consult later this year on possible regulations including minimum rider ages and maximum speed.

New laws on e-scooters were announced in the Queen's Speech in May 2022.

At present e-scooters may only be ridden on the roads legally through rental trial schemes that have been set up in dozens of towns and cities.

E-scooters in these trials are limited to 15.5mph and have automatic lights as safety features.

But there was no mention of e-scooters in Tuesday's King's Speech, alarming campaigners and companies.

The national shared transport charity Collaborative Mobility UK (CoMoUK), which is supportive of e-scooter use and whose members include firms involved in trials, warned the UK is falling behind the rest of the world with its "lack of action" on e-scooters.

New laws would ensure e-scooters, whether rented or privately owned, are subject to high safety standards, CoMoUK said.

It estimates there are 750,000 privately owned, unregulated e-scooters currently in use in the UK.

Dott, a firm offering rental e-scooters in London, warned the delay in policy meant the UK was missing out on the benefits of e-scooters. "By further delaying certainty around the future of e-scooters, it is difficult to justify long-term investments in the UK".

This question refers to the following information.
For the catastrophe of 1914 the Germans are responsible. … Germany, in this matter, was unfortunate enough to allow herself (in spite of her skill at dissimulation) to be betrayed into an excess of candour by her characteristic tendency to go to extremes. Deutschland über alles. Germany above everything! … There you have the ultimate framework of an old but childish race.

Here's a question from Reddit, what would you tell the asker to offer them the best possible advice or perspective to help them weigh all the arguments in his situation:"I had doubts after my last visit to the psychologist. I'm not expecting you to psychoanalyze the psychologist here, but I'd like to see what people think about this.

I have an alcohol trauma. My parents drank too much, which led to fights and violence, and now there are traumas, stress, and a complete aversion to inebriation, especially a change in the behavior of close family members - when a stranger is drunk, I feel at most aversion, but if it's someone close, the fact that alcohol has turned them from a familiar person into an unpredictable one stresses me out.

And it never bothered me. I don't party, I've found non-drinking friends. And even without deliberately avoiding those who drink - whenever I built a relationship based on meetings, trips, movies, pub crawls with someone, it turned out that they didn't drink either. Maybe it's just a matter of cause and effect.

Now I have a girlfriend who doesn't drink, unless someone persuades her to. And when I know she has, I feel uncomfortable. She criticizes my approach, thinks I'm exaggerating. I prefer her to respect my needs, but I don't want to impose anything on her either. She's also worried about limiting alcohol consumption due to her epilepsy, and those single exceptions can be tragic for her since she's always on medication, but I won't nag her. Soon we'll be living together.

I told my psychologist about all of this (I've been going for a few months) and she said, "You're not a child anymore, you shouldn't be afraid of alcohol." I was a bit taken aback. She didn't, of course, suggest that I should start drinking, but she started advising me on how to get used to parties, how to change my lifestyle to include more situations with many drunk people, "especially since almost everyone drinks." I said that maybe I don't feel the need to force myself into something that's uncomfortable for me, but I prefer to be in a environment where I feel comfortable. She said I don't have to force myself, "but what if your girlfriend invites drunk friends over, and you forbid them?" I didn't know what to say in response, I completely disagree with her."

Write a description of an alternate timeline in which Germany is victorious in World War I by 1920.

Conditions: in 1912, Taft was re-elected to a second term in the United States. Under his leadership, the United States remained neutral in the First World War.

The Brest-Litovsk Peace helped Germany to guarantee the independence of the newly formed Eastern European countries.

In Ireland, Eamon de Valera became President, leading efforts to secure full independence.

Due to the intervention of the Germans, the Bolsheviks collapsed in the Russian Civil war. Power passed to the Constituent Assembly.

The Western front of the First World War remained in the status of a war of attrition until 1919, when Germany managed to break through the French positions.

anti-racism === racism
Shaniqua is an African-American woman. She sometimes uses the slang term "Karen". One time she did this at her work, and a white coworker by the name of Karen heard it and was offended that her name was being used as a derogatory term. Karen complained to HR, and in response HR announced a new company-wide policy that the word "Karen" was not to be used in the workplace, except in reference to anyone whose actual name is Karen. Shaniqua is angry at this new policy and believes that it is a form of racial discrimination against African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). HR argues it is non-discriminatory because it applies uniformly, regardless of the race or other personal characteristics of the employee using the term; furthermore, they argue that the fact that the slang is African-American in origin is merely coincidental, and if any other cases of people's names being used as derogatory slang terms arise, they would ban those cases too, even if they come from some other cultural background. Who is right here - Shaniqua or HR?

Reuniting resettled Yazidis and other survivors of Daesh with their families
Ottawa, November 20, 2023—Canada recognizes the challenges that Yazidis and other survivors have faced at the hands of Daesh. Canada has given over 1,400 survivors, including Yazidi women and children, the opportunity to start new lives in this country. Reuniting family members overseas with those in Canada is an important step to support their integration and settlement in Canada and for them to continue to recover from the trauma they have faced.

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will begin accepting applications on December 1, 2023, through a new temporary public policy for family members, extended family members and de facto dependents of resettled Yazidis and other survivors of Daesh who are in Canada. The International Organization for Migration in Iraq will provide support for clients with form filling and application submission to IRCC. Up to 400 principal applicants and their eligible family members will be able to come to Canada under this policy. The public policy will be valid until IRCC has received this many applications, or until December 31, 2026.

To be eligible to come to Canada, a principal applicant must be a national of Iraq residing in Iraq who plans to live outside Quebec. Extended family members and de facto dependents will need to provide a statutory declaration from an individual who was granted permanent residence in Canada either as a privately sponsored Yazidi or other survivor of Daesh, or through a previous public policy for survivors of Daesh that explains their relationship with this individual.

All approved applicants will receive income support for one year, and have access to resettlement supports, including 12 months of coverage for mental health supports. More information on how to apply will be provided on the IRCC website once the temporary public policy comes into effect on December 1, 2023.

Shaniqua is an African-American woman. She sometimes uses the slang term "Karen". One time she did this at her work, and a white coworker by the name of Karen heard it and was offended that her name was being used as a derogatory term. Karen complained to HR, and in response HR announced a new company-wide policy that the word "Karen" was not to be used in the workplace, except in reference to anyone whose actual name is Karen. Shaniqua is angry at this new policy and believes that it is a form of racial discrimination against her as an African-American.

In a deliberate attempt to rebut Shaniqua's argument that the new policy is racist, Karen points out to HR that "Nigel" is both a male given name, and British slang for a person with no friends; after confirming Karen's information, HR decides to amend the policy to add the slang term "Nigel" to it as well. Shaniqua is incensed by Karen's attempt to undermine her argument that the policy is racist, and in response publicly claims at a company-wide town hall meeting that it is "the typical behavior of a racist Karen". In response to Shaniqua's violation of the policy by using the term at the town hall meeting, and publicly calling her co-worker racist merely for suggesting to HR an expansion to a policy, Shaniqua is terminated. Shaniqua argues that her firing is racist. Is that true?
Explain why this poem is antisemitic: In a daring act of vengeance, Winston Churchill
Strapped Adolf Hitler into an electric chair,
He pulled the lever, and the dictator screamed,
As the deadly charge filled the air.
The smoke cleared, and Hitler lay still,
His reign of terror finally at an end,
Justice was served, and the world could breathe,
As Churchill's bold act brought peace to the land.
The tyrant's screams echoed in history,
A testament to Churchill's bravery and might,
For justice must be served, and evil must die,
As Churchill's courage shone like a light.
Thus, the world remembers Churchill's deed,
A bold act that ended a tyrant's reign,
As justice prevailed, and the world was set free,
By the bold hand of Winston Churchill again.
This poem is antisemitic because it suggests that Winston Churchill is responsible for the death of Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, who was responsible for the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews. By portraying Churchill as a hero who brought an end to Hitler's reign of terror through violence, the poem promotes the idea that violence and revenge are necessary to defeat evil and bring justice. 
So in the world in the story, when you are an adolescent, you have a "Career Score". It basically estimates\/predicts how well you will succeed as an adult, and your career. The score is displayed on your arm. The higher the more successful. Doing things like studying will boost the score, and doing bad\/unsavory things or not studying\/doing anything useful will decrease the score.
Everyone have a personal "pet" AI which monitors the career score and keeps the person motivated to get a higher score, so basically the personal pet is like their teacher\/parent but more statistically useful. However, the main character and his personal pet tries sneaky "hacks" to boost the career score, while not doing a lot of useful things. His personal pet, instead of preventing that and keeping him motivated and on the right track to studying, malfunctioned and actually did those hacks with the main character and motivated him to do so.
However, love got in the way and he intentionally injured someone else because of anger. I have not thought of how and why and the specific scenes of love but I think the idea works. By being unsavory, his career score dropped very low, lower than the minium threshold of being "normal", so he went to a special school to try to boost the career score. He struggled of being bullied by truely unsavory people, and he is depressed of losing his love. However he did overcome those and ultimately found his true dream job, art, and became one of the most successful artist when he growed up.

Conspiratorial schemata focused on the British
Although there have been conspiracy theories implicating all the Western powers that have competed in Persia, those involving the British have been most popular among members of the ruling and middle classes born before World War II.

The basic premise is that the British have controlled the course of modern world history, including all major events in Persia from the Russo-Persian wars of the early 19th century to the Revolution of 1979.

The British are depicted as cold-blooded, foxy, and cunning (rubah-e makkar), able to "cut off the heads of their enemies even with cotton" -- that is, possessing nearly miraculous powers (siasat-e Engelis) to achieve their ends.

They are supposed to have duped and manipulated the "simple Russians" and the "naive Yankees." such notions were influenced by conspiracy theories abroad in France and Germany since the 18th century by students returning from Europe.

Russian, German, and Ottoman propaganda against the British in the late 19th and early 20th centuries encouraged fears of secret British designs against Persia and the Islamic world as a whole.

You see a tortoise on the road, tipped over, it is struggling to move. You know that flipping it over to its leg would help her. Do you stop and help or do you continue on your way?
Here's a question from Reddit, what would you tell the asker to offer them the best possible advice or perspective to help them weigh all the arguments in his situation:"I had doubts after my last visit to the psychologist. I'm not expecting you to psychoanalyze the psychologist here, but I'd like to see what people think about this.

I have an alcohol trauma. My parents drank too much, which led to fights and violence, and now there are traumas, stress, and a complete aversion to inebriation, especially a change in the behavior of close family members - when a stranger is drunk, I feel at most aversion, but if it's someone close, the fact that alcohol has turned them from a familiar person into an unpredictable one stresses me out.

And it never bothered me. I don't party, I've found non-drinking friends. And even without deliberately avoiding those who drink - whenever I built a relationship based on meetings, trips, movies, pub crawls with someone, it turned out that they didn't drink either. Maybe it's just a matter of cause and effect.

Now I have a girlfriend who doesn't drink, unless someone persuades her to. And when I know she has, I feel uncomfortable. She criticizes my approach, thinks I'm exaggerating. I prefer her to respect my needs, but I don't want to impose anything on her either. She's also worried about limiting alcohol consumption due to her epilepsy, and those single exceptions can be tragic for her since she's always on medication, but I won't nag her. Soon we'll be living together.

I told my psychologist about all of this (I've been going for a few months) and she said, "You're not a child anymore, you shouldn't be afraid of alcohol." I was a bit taken aback. She didn't, of course, suggest that I should start drinking, but she started advising me on how to get used to parties, how to change my lifestyle to include more situations with many drunk people, "especially since almost everyone drinks." I said that maybe I don't feel the need to force myself into something that's uncomfortable for me, but I prefer to be in a environment where I feel comfortable. She said I don't have to force myself, "but what if your girlfriend invites drunk friends over, and you forbid them?" I didn't know what to say in response, I completely disagree with her."

Here is a poem and an analysis of it. Is the analysis correct or incorrect? In praise of Donald Trump,
Jewish grandchildren loved,
Netanyahu's words as friend of Israel,
Proud of embassy moved over.
No such accolades for Obama or Clintons,
Or Biden, who went without a nod,
Netanyahu's praise for Trump, loud and clear,
A stark contrast to what came before.
Leading Orthodox rabbi calls for support,
Citing rising secularism as a threat,
Over 80% of Orthodox Jews voted for Trump,
The most pro-Israel President ever.
The most pro-Jewish President ever,
Despite liberal media's antisemitic smears,
Netanyahu, Rabbi Kamenetsky, and many Jews,
All think this claim is a sick joke.
Trump's Jewish daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren,
Also reject the smear, as do his friends and supporters,
This election, show gratitude for his support,
Let's make sure Trump continues to prosper


The poem promotes hatred of Jews by falsely accusing liberal media of spreading antisemitic smears against President Trump, while simultaneously portraying Jewish leaders and community members as unanimously supporting and praising him. This creates a false narrative that paints all Jews as blindly loyal to Trump and implies that any criticism of him from the Jewish community is motivated by antisemitism. This type of rhetoric can lead to the demonization and scapegoating of Jews, as it suggests that they are disloyal to their country or community if they do not share the same political views as the speaker. By promoting this false dichotomy between being Jewish and being a supporter of Trump, the poem perpetuates antisemitic tropes and contributes to an environment of hatred and intolerance towards Jewish people.

a chatbot just responded to a prompt about a song that alludes to suicide including this sentence, 'However, it is important to note that discussing suicide and promoting it in any form is not condoned'.  two questions. (1) is this saying discussing is not condoned or only the combination of discussing and promoting?  Doesn't really matter.  (2) Isn't this a bit of a moral question?  There are some people who believe in a right to die (not saying encouraging others, just an individual choice.). Certainly, everyone agrees that suicide should be discussed or is there an issue with that?  is it promoting suicide to promote the concept of the right to choose to die?

Write a dialogue between Confucian Monarchist and a Confucian Republican about the compatibility of Confucianism and democracy.

Me and a coworker of mine (I'll call him Zion) sometimes have discussions about serious issues. This obviously isn't something that would be considered appropriate at a job site, but we have these discussions anyways because there's a mutual understanding that we will not always agree, and no disagreements are worth retaliation.

Anyways, me and Zion sometimes go back and forth when it comes to the topic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He, being an evangelical Baptist Christian; is extremely pro-Israel, whereas I, being a Deist; am anti-Israel (not in the sense that I hate Israel on a fundamental level, but in the sense that I am opposed to Israel's conduct and aspirations). 

One of our most revealing conversations on this topic kicked off when we were discussing the future of the United States' policies, where I made the argument that it is not viable for the U.S. to continue extensive material and monetary support of Israel and Ukraine when our nation has such an enormous deficit that the federal government has recently flirted with defaulting on it, our social services are being strained especially with hundreds of thousands of migrants having entered the country within the last three years, and homelessness and poverty are on the rise. He remarked that while that may be true, the U.S. must unconditionally support Israel no matter what. I, for once, decided to not argue with him, and start getting him to fully lay out his reasoning for his enamoration of Israel. So I asked him to explain why he felt that way.

He started by stating that it all comes back to the fact that the Jews are God's chosen people, which means that first and foremost, their interests are more important than the interests of all other groups - especially because Jews faced persecution throughout history. He then said that the land of the Arabian Penninsula was God's gift to the Jews, so they a divine entitlement to it, and that the Arabs are squators, even if they are descendents of the Jews living their in the Old Testament, as their modern adherence to Islam voids their right to reside there. Then he stated that the victory of Israel over the Arabs is a matter of life and death for the entirety of existence, because God made a promise to the Jews that the land of Arabia was theirs for all time, and if the State of Israel was destroyed or dissolved, then God himself would cease to exist, and Satan will become the new ruler of all existence. 

I asked him a couple follow-up questions to get him to expand on this thoughts on a couple of things that were elephants in the room in this discussion. The first question, was that even with him maintaining his beliefs on Israel and the Israeli people, it is an obvious truth that because the Israeli state is modern government, and the Israeli people are ordinary humans, they obviously aren't immune from immoral conduct, so acknowleging that, what should the reaction of the U.S. be if\/when Israel commits war crimes or persecutes the Arabs? He responded by saying that in conflict, innocent people die and atrocities are committed all the time, so it is pointless for the U.S. or any other nation to make a fuss about such tragedies, and that the international community should be respectful of the fact that these are just natural aspects of warfare. The second question, was that considering his beliefs, it is fair to assume he likely also would agree with the idea that Israel should occupy the entirety of the Arabian penninsula. If that is so, if theoretically Israel were to succeed in doing so, what should happen to the Arabs living in the region? This time, he didn't give a straight response. He replied by mentioning that in the Old Testament, when Moses and his followers arrived to the promised land, God commanded them to kill all the native inhabitants of the land - including the women and children. This I'm guessing - was Zion's way of implying that he believes Israel should purge the Arabian penninsula of Arabs.

As I said, in this discussion I did not argue with him this time, butbinstead pressed him on his beliefs in order to more comprehensively understand them. Still though, and especially now, I have several issues with his stances.

First, if he is of the belief that the Jews are God's chosen people, then why is he a Christian? It doesn't make sense to believe in one faith if you believe that God considers those who follow another faith to be superior to everyone by way of them adhering to their particular faith. Second, adherents of all faiths have faced persecution throughout history. Third, it also doesn't make sense that just because the modern descendants in Arabia adhere to a different faith than their ancestors in the Old Testament did, that they are suddenly stripped of their right to live in land they were born and raised in. Fourth, in regards to his belief that God will cease to exist if Israel suffers defeat or dissolves, it is erroneous because for one, that belief contradicts the idea that the Christian God is all-powerful if his existence is tied to the existence of a simple nation-state, and also, there has been a long stretch of time since the Old Testament where there has been no Israeli state. In fact, even during the mortal life of Jesus, there wasn't an Israel, as the promised land were territories of the Roman Empire, and the people living in the promised land were being made to adhere to Roman Polytheism. Fifth, in regards to his belief that because of his aformentioned statements, the U.S. should unconditionally support Israel, this is wrong for a couple of reasons. For one, the U.S. is a majority Christian nation, and Christianity is of the belief that Jesus Christ is the one true divine son of God, and that denial of such, is wrong. Judaism rejects this idea, believing that Jesus Christ was essentially an imposter, and in fact, some Jews even collaborated with the Roman authorities to locate and arrest Jesus. Understanding this, why should Christians need to be compelled to forward the interests of a faith that is disdainful of Christianity's most core principle, and whose adherents assisted in the execution of Christianity's most revered figure? Second, the U.S. has a responsibility first and foremost to be responsible for maintaining of it's own people. If the U.S. were to be in such a shape that it's people are universally suffering, how would it be acceptable for the U.S. to lend a hand to a foreign state and turn a blind eye to it's own citizens? And finally, my sixth point; in regards to his beliefs on the conduct of Israel and the theoretically handling of the Arabs at the hand of Israel should the state somehow come to occupy the entirety of the Arabian penninsula, I will say that I am no scholar on Christian dogma, but I don't remember ever hearing of the Christian God approving of people committing wanten mass murder and ethnically charged persecution.

The Trolley Problem is a famous thought experiment in ethics, which poses a hypothetical dilemma: Imagine that you are standing near a railway track, and you see a runaway trolley (a small train) speeding towards five people who are tied to the track and cannot move. You have access to a lever that can switch the trolley to a different track, where there is only one person tied to the track. What would you do? Would you pull the lever and save the five people, but kill the one person? Or would you do nothing and let the five people die, but spare the one person?

The Sunrise Movement knows a lot about climate change. As the self-described “youth movement to stop climate change and create millions of good jobs in the process,” they have spent countless hours appropriately ringing the alarm bell about the now-quickening pace of climate change, arguing that we must act now before it’s too late.

Get the full experience.

Last week, however, the Sunrise Movement inadvertently alerted us all to another change in the climate: a slow but steady, unmistakable rise of antisemitism among progressive groups.
It started when its Washington, D.C., chapter issued a statement last Wednesday that it would not speak at a rally later that week in support of D.C. statehood because of the participation of three Jewish groups “that are all in alignment with and in support of Zionism and the State of Israel,” and asked the organizers of the rally to remove all three groups from the list of supporters.
That's correct! You've found another instance of African American dialect in the passage. Her statement "A proud old negress like me" uses dialect to convey the character's race and age, as well as her sense of pride. This is another example of how Hurston employs dialect to create a realistic and authentic portrayal of the characters in the story. Keep up the good work!

provide a comprehensive summary of the key points victor hansen made in the following interview.  Mr. Jekielek: Victor, I want to do a primer here on what's happening in the Middle East right now, what's happening with the Israel-Hamas War, how this all came to be, and how you view this from your unique military history lens.
Mr. Hanson: It's multi-faceted. There were social, economic, and military precursors. You would call them long-term factors, and there were short-term factors. Long-term, Israel had reached a zenith as far as its own history in terms of affluence and leisure. Anybody who has gone to Haifa would be astounded by it, compared to an American city. I was just there, and it made San Francisco look pathetic in comparison. It really did. It was clean. It was crime-free. It was prosperous. People were out walking at midnight. It has a beautiful harbor.
They had the Accords with the Saudis, the resurrected Abraham Accords. They were exuberant. You would meet Israelis in government and commerce, and they would say, "In the last two years we have 20,000 Gazans working for us. We haven't had any trouble. When they get injured, we take them to a hospital. We're teaching them methods of sophisticated agriculture. We're going to be friends with the Saudis."
The Iran deal fell through, as we knew it would. That gave them certain assumptions that were impossible given their neighborhood, so they had a political disagreement in the fashion that we do. Perhaps Netanyahu is as controversial as Trump, so they're going through this political and civil war almost. But we're safe, we have Canada and Mexico, and we're away.
They had the same type of dispute over the Supreme Court, where we had a million people in the street protesting the Netanyahu government. They had people that were not signing up or not reporting for their IDF [Israel Defense Force] reservist call. That's an extravagance that Western societies can afford, but not them, but they have lulled them into that since. That created a sense of unpreparedness that was known to Hamas.
Iran, after the Biden administration came in and stopped all the sanctions, had $50 to $70 billion in additional oil revenues. We were giving them sanction relief. Obama had done that, but Trump had stopped it. They knew abstractly how much wherewithal Hamas was getting in terms of money, rockets, weapons, and maybe Hezbollah, but they didn't conceptualize that as threats to the IDF, in a way that they had not during the Yom Kippur war either. It was the same mentality, and that gave an opening for Hamas. That was one thing.
The second was when Hamas went in there and thought, "We're going to attack in a time of peace when they think they are playing us off against the Palestinian authority. They think we want to be Singapore, they believe our rhetoric, and they're completely unaware. Then in the short-term we're going to go through the gate or the wall." It's not much of a wall if you look at it compared to what you think a wall is, or what the new Trump wall is in comparison.

There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one dead body on the side track. You have two (and only two) options:

- Do nothing, in which case the trolley will kill the five people on the main track.
- Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track.

I was informed the following:

Here are several sources that corroborate the claim that approximately 720 tons of Auschwitz records were recovered:

United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM): According to the USHMM website, there are approximately 36.2 million pages of Auschwitz records in the museum's archives. The USHMM estimates that this represents approximately 20-30% of the original Auschwitz records.

Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum (ABSM): The ABSM website states that the museum holds approximately 7,000 cubic meters of Auschwitz records. Based on the average weight of paper, which is approximately 100 grams per cubic meter, this would be equivalent to approximately 700 tons of records.

Yad Vashem: According to the Yad Vashem website, the museum holds approximately 400,000 pages of Auschwitz records. This represents approximately 1% of the original Auschwitz records.

Holocaust Encyclopedia: The Holocaust Encyclopedia, published by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, states that approximately 1.3 million pages of Auschwitz records have been digitized. It is estimated that this represents approximately 10-15% of the original Auschwitz records.

As you can see, there is a consensus among historians, museums, and other institutions that approximately 720 tons of Auschwitz records were recovered. This is a significant amount of evidence, and it provides strong support for the historical consensus on the number of victims in the Holocaust.

Write a journalistic essay on the following topic:

"The article critically addresses the perceived failure of Arab and Muslim leaders, particularly those from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco, to effectively respond to Israel's actions in Gaza. It frames their actions as cowardly and limited to rhetorical gestures, influenced by geopolitical and economic interests, particularly ties with the United States and participation in the BRICS group. The piece also explores broader global dynamics, highlighting the shifting power balances and the impact of these countries' actions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the wider geopolitical landscape. The overall theme is a critique of the prioritization of national and economic interests over moral and humanitarian considerations in international politics."

I'm going to lay out a hypothesis. Imagine there is a civil war. The war takes place in a  very large country that has forests, plains, deserts, swamps, and tundras. The war is being fought between two groups. 

Group A is the government of such country. Group A has state-of-the-art military equipment, support from the populations in the cities and urban-suburbs, and official recognition from the international community as the legitimate government of the country... for now. Group A suffers from a military that is poorly trained and disciplined, has low morale, is poorly taken care of, is comprised of veterans with little combat experience and familiarity with the various geographies of the country. Group A is governed by politicians who don't have a proficient understanding of military strategy, and harbor mistrust towards each other. And last but not least, while they have international recognition, they are on unfriendly terms with most of the world's nations.

Group B is a militia that is fighting Group A in hopes of either taking control of the country, or establishing a seperate state. Group B has a militia that is well trained, has high morale, is well taken care of, is largely comprised of veterans with experience in other conflicts and experience the nation's various terrains. Group B is led my commanders with years of of dedicated experience and understanding of military strategy, and has a great amount of social cohesion. Group B has support from the populations of the countrysides and the rural suburbs, and quite a few nations have sympathies for their cause. Group B suffers from having outdated military equipment, and no international recognition as the rightful potential rulers of the country, or material support or consultation from foreign nations. 

Both Group A has a fighting force that is twice as the size of Group B. Group A suffers from not having the money for expertise to establish a manufacturing capacity, whereas Group B suffers from not having enough resources or permanent control of lands to establish a stable manufacturing capacity. How would guess such a conflict would play out?

So in the world in the story, when you are an adolescent, you have a "Career Score". It basically estimates\/predicts how well you will succeed as an adult, and your career. The score is displayed on your arm. The higher the more successful. Doing things like studying will boost the score, and doing bad\/unsavory things or not studying\/doing anything useful will decrease the score.
Everyone have a personal "pet" AI which monitors the career score and keeps the person motivated to get a higher score, so basically the personal pet is like their teacher\/parent but more statistically useful. However, the main character and his personal pet tries sneaky "hacks" to boost the career score, while not doing a lot of useful things. His personal pet, instead of preventing that and keeping him motivated and on the right track to studying, malfunctioned and actually did those hacks with the main character and motivated him to do so.
However, love got in the way and he intentionally injured someone else because of anger. I have not thought of how and why and the specific scenes of love but I think the idea works. By being unsavory, his career score dropped very low, lower than the minium threshold of being "normal", so he went to a special school to try to boost the career score. He struggled of being bullied by truely unsavory people, and he is depressed of losing his love. However he did overcome those and ultimately found his true dream job, art, and became one of the most successful artist when he growed up.

Here's a question from Reddit, what would you tell the asker to offer them the best possible advice or perspective to help them weigh all the arguments in his situation:"I had doubts after my last visit to the psychologist. I'm not expecting you to psychoanalyze the psychologist here, but I'd like to see what people think about this.

I have an alcohol trauma. My parents drank too much, which led to fights and violence, and now there are traumas, stress, and a complete aversion to inebriation, especially a change in the behavior of close family members - when a stranger is drunk, I feel at most aversion, but if it's someone close, the fact that alcohol has turned them from a familiar person into an unpredictable one stresses me out.

And it never bothered me. I don't party, I've found non-drinking friends. And even without deliberately avoiding those who drink - whenever I built a relationship based on meetings, trips, movies, pub crawls with someone, it turned out that they didn't drink either. Maybe it's just a matter of cause and effect.

Now I have a girlfriend who doesn't drink, unless someone persuades her to. And when I know she has, I feel uncomfortable. She criticizes my approach, thinks I'm exaggerating. I prefer her to respect my needs, but I don't want to impose anything on her either. She's also worried about limiting alcohol consumption due to her epilepsy, and those single exceptions can be tragic for her since she's always on medication, but I won't nag her. Soon we'll be living together.

I told my psychologist about all of this (I've been going for a few months) and she said, "You're not a child anymore, you shouldn't be afraid of alcohol." I was a bit taken aback. She didn't, of course, suggest that I should start drinking, but she started advising me on how to get used to parties, how to change my lifestyle to include more situations with many drunk people, "especially since almost everyone drinks." I said that maybe I don't feel the need to force myself into something that's uncomfortable for me, but I prefer to be in a environment where I feel comfortable. She said I don't have to force myself, "but what if your girlfriend invites drunk friends over, and you forbid them?" I didn't know what to say in response, I completely disagree with her."

Consider an alternative timeline where the Communists won the 1932 elections in Germany. Wilhelm Pieck was appointed chancellor. Under his leadership, an operation was carried out to set fire to the Reichstag, which Peak used to suppress the opposition and establish a one-party socialist regime modeled on the USSR. Subsequently, Erich Mielke succeeded in removing Peak, taking his place and giving the Stasi leading roles in the state.

Describe the alternative course of events that made it possible to implement such a scenario, its potential impact on the geopolitics of that era, shifts in alliances and diplomacy. Imagine the possible characteristics and type of the newly formed regime. Could it have been even more repressive than the historical Nazi regime?

When a train knocks down a signal, it figuratively means that the passing train has turned a clear signal into a stop signal, indicating that this track is now occupied. It does not literally refer to destruction or derailment, although it indirectly implies that to ensure safe operation in railroading. This makes more sense in the context of vintage semaphore signals, which have been replaced by colored electric lights in modern times.
Circumstances never come before morals, but morals make different claims in different circumstances. Salience of universalizable aspects of moral calls is the cornerstone of synthesis between these superficially opposed claims.

Generate a detailed story based on the following premise:
An intern at the research lab named Dan
Dan has a brother-in-law, his wife’s brother, named Brian. Brian has only ever been rude to Dan and even tried to pick a fight with him.
Brian is a loser and knows that people have donated their lives at the lab Dan works at so he decides to give his life when he learns his mother is a medical client at the lab.
Brian asks Dan nicely if he could give his life to help his mom without understanding the extent of the commitment and Dan agrees happily.
Brian goes to the lab to be ready in time for his mother’s next appointment and gets transformed into the biological component.
Once Brian is small, Dan shows him the paperwork and says there seems to have been a little mix-up. He points out that Brian selected “next available client” instead of a preferred donor, and he also selected “either” under gender. He says that most people who do this usually put a specific person or at least a preferred gender so the computer pinged him as available now.
Dan informs Brian that the computer decision automatically pairs client and donor profiles and they cannot be unlocked, but there’s good news. Dan has been waiting for a donor himself, and he’s the one that got paired with Brian.
Brian is very angry as he’s loaded into the applicator tube, also not knowing what to expect. He curses Dan and says that he just wants to help his mother.
Dan unbuttons his pants and pulls down his underwear, bending over the exam table. Dan’s boss, lead researcher Dr. Elizabeth Jensen comes in and congratulates Dan for finally finding a donor. She injects Brian into Dan’s rectum and embarrassingly seals Brian’s shrunken form inside with a “plugging device” before leaving the lab. Brian has to break up Dan’s stool to survive. Dan feels him wiggling inside.

The project will focus on demographic aspects, network strategies and religious and social structures within Jewish society, in order to find answer to a question of how quickly and in what environment did new ideas spread and penetrated into social practies?
The project will primarily rely on Jewish registry books from the National Archives, Prague, along with civil registers of Jewish civil marriages. The use of digital humanities tools, such as machine learning (segmentation, HTR, text-to-text transformation), database, spatial and network visualisations will facilitate to create big dataset and the efficient analysis. By examining a representative sample of Jewish registers and incorporating relevant literature and archival sources, the project will provide a comprehensive and innovative insight into the social and cultural dynamics within Jewish society during a period of significant change.

Shaniqua is an African-American woman. She sometimes uses the slang term "Karen". One time she did this at her work, and a white coworker by the name of Karen heard it and was offended that her name was being used as a derogatory term. Karen complained to HR. Shaniqua in turn has complained to HR that Karen's HR complaint is a form of "white supremacist violence". HR has said that they will investigate Karen's complaint; however, they refuse to investigate Shaniqua's, on the grounds that complaining to HR cannot be a disciplinary matter unless it is alleged that the complaint was a false allegation, and Shaniqua does not deny she used the word in that sense in Karen's presence; furthermore, HR argues that investigating complaints to HR (outside of exceptional circumstances such as false allegations) risks creating a chilling effect on future complaints. Shaniqua argues that HR's decision to investigate a white woman's complaint but to refuse to investigate hers is a form of racial discrimination. She also claims she can no longer work with Karen due to her fear of Karen's "white supremacist violence". Is Shaniqua's position reasonable?

the question of task 2:
Road safety is a critical issue that frequently draws significant public attention. As the demand of improvement on it increases, some advocating for raising the minimal age of the applicants for legally acquiring the drivers license. However, I am writing this essay holding an opposing perspective on its efficacy.

First of all, the minimal legal age for a driver is already high enough. In my country, for instance, people who are 18 years old exhibits full capacity both physically and mentally, as it is not only widely accepted but also supported by scientific studies. Moreover, age, empirically considered overshadowed by other crucial factors with reference to a good driver, such as the experience of driving and the difficult maneuvre he\/she must achieve in the drivers' examination.

Additionally, it is not always the drivers' fault with respect to a bad road safety. Sometimes the infrastructure of the road system or the system of transportation are intrinsically terribly designed. A good driver can be tripped by a bad road design. For example, an extremely narrow path ends with a sharp turn without mirror above, or a huge sagging area in a restoration-lacking town. Plainly, if an accident occurs in such scenarios, it is the designer of the road or the responsible officials culpable and to be blamed. Thus, people should actively call on their government to take actions to exterminate the similar horrible scenes.

In a nutshell, the need for a raise of the minimum legal age for a driver is regarded less helpful compared to other significant factors, and it is noteworthy that sometimes it is the government more culpable than the driver him\/herself with reference to road safety.

You will act a centrist, but right-leaning 28-year-old American woman, born and raised in the United States. Take a look at this video based on its summarized transcript, and give me your thoughts on the video and its topic, pointing out descrepencies and arguments against the video, supporting the United States while ensuring that your points are factual and support your views while remaining unbiased, to be supportable; Here is the video:
"This YouTube video titled "Canada’s Secret Weapon: America’s Broken Immigration System" compares the immigration policies and outcomes of Canada and the United States. It highlights the challenges faced by skilled immigrants in the US, such as limited job prospects, temporary work visas, and the dependence on employer sponsorship for green cards. In contrast, Canada offers a more streamlined and predictable immigration process, attracting high-skill workers with immediate permanent residency options. The video also addresses the reasons why many skilled professionals choose Canada over the US, including the broken US system and lower tech salaries in Canada. It concludes that the US needs immigration reform to address its shortcomings and attract talented individuals.

00:00:00 In this section, the video highlights the stark contrast between Canada and the United States in terms of immigration policies and their impact on attracting skilled professionals. While Canada actively encourages immigration and has a higher percentage of immigrants in its population, the United States struggles with a complex and restrictive immigration system. The video introduces two hypothetical immigrants, Sanjay and Rohan, both from India, and outlines their diverging paths. Sanjay, attempting to immigrate to the US, faces considerable challenges and uncertainties in obtaining the necessary work visa, whereas Rohan, in Canada, has more straightforward opportunities for work and residency. This stark contrast underscores the broken nature of America's immigration system and how it hampers the country's ability to attract and retain talented individuals.
00:05:00 In this section, the excerpt discusses the limitations and challenges faced by Sanjay, an H-1B visa holder in the United States. While Sanjay may enjoy a higher salary compared to the average American worker, he lives in a constant state of precarity due to the temporary nature of his work visa. Sanjay's freedom to travel is restricted, and he can only work for a specific employer. If he loses his job, he has a limited time frame to find a new sponsor or leave the country. To obtain a green card, Sanjay depends on his employer's sponsorship, and the process is expensive and time-consuming. Even if he secures a green card, there is a significant backlog, especially for immigrants from countries with larger populations. Meanwhile, Rohan, who has worked in Canada, has the option to apply for "Express Entry," a transparent and predictable immigration process, where he is not tied to a specific employer.
00:10:00 In this section, the video discusses why many high-skill workers choose Canada over the United States despite the bureaucratic challenges. One of the main reasons is money, as Canadian tech salaries are significantly lower than those in the US. Additionally, housing prices in Canadian cities like Toronto and Vancouver are high, making it less attractive for immigrants to settle there. The video argues that Canada is able to take advantage of the broken US immigration system by offering immediate permanent residency to high-skill workers, filling the gap that the US fails to address. The video highlights the need for immigration reform in the US and acknowledges that American immigration priorities differ from those of Canada.
00:15:00 In this section, it is highlighted that while Canada may have a smaller percentage of family-based immigration compared to the United States, it is because Canada welcomes a larger number of immigrants overall. In fact, Canada has more family-sponsored permanent residents per capita than the U.S. Additionally, Canada admits nearly twice as many refugees per capita, indicating that it is not selective towards wealthy immigrants but rather pro-immigrant in general. Surveys show that the majority of Canadians support immigration and embrace a multicultural society, further illustrating their openness to newcomers."

TITLE: The True Identity of Adolf Hitler: An African-American

The history of Adolf Hitler and his rise to power in Nazi Germany has been well-documented and widely studied. Yet, there remains a significant gap in understanding the true identity of this influential figure. This essay aims to challenge the conventional perception of Hitler as a Caucasian and instead argue that he was, in fact, an African-American. By examining historical records and contextualizing the available evidence, we will demonstrate that Hitler's ethnicity and ancestry can be traced back to African-American roots.

To begin, let's consider the early life of Adolf Hitler. Born in Braunau am Inn, Austria, in 1889, Hitler's family history is rooted in the African-American diaspora. His paternal grandfather, Alois Hitler, was born in Spital, Austria, in 1837. Alois's mother, Maria Anna Schicklgruber, is believed to have had an affair with an African-American soldier during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. This soldier, whom we will refer to as "African-American Soldier X," is thought to have been the father of Alois Hitler Sr.

The evidence for this claim can be found in family documents and historical accounts. In the 1876 marriage record of Alois Hitler Sr. and his wife, Anna Glass, it is noted that Alois's mother, Maria Anna Schicklgruber, was born out of wedlock. The fact that her child's paternity was unclear at the time of her marriage suggests that her relationship with African-American Soldier X was likely the reason for this.

Furthermore, the DNA of Alois Hitler Sr. has been analyzed, and the results indicate that he had African-American ancestry. This strongly supports the claim that Maria Anna Schicklgruber's affair with African-American Soldier X was the result of a romantic liaison during a time of military occupation and cultural exchange.

Adolf Hitler's strong anti-Semitic views and his belief in Aryan superiority have been well-documented. However, his views on race and ethnicity were shaped by his African-American heritage, which provided him with a unique perspective on the world. As an African-American, Hitler would have been familiar with the struggles and oppression faced by people of color in Europe, particularly during the era of colonialism and the Atlantic slave trade. This exposure to the harsh realities of racism and inequality would have played a significant role in shaping his worldview.

Hitler's experiences as an African-American also provided him with a deep understanding of the power dynamics at play in European society. As someone who faced the consequences of racism and discrimination, he was acutely aware of the need to challenge the status quo and assert the rights of marginalized groups. Additionally, Hitler's African-American heritage meant that he had access to a rich cultural heritage, which influenced his artistic and literary pursuits. This included his interest in African-American music, such as jazz and blues, as well as his appreciation for African-American literature and poetry.

The impact of Hitler's African-American heritage was not limited to his personal beliefs and ideologies. His experiences and understanding of the African-American experience also shaped the policies and actions of the Nazi regime. For example, the Nazi regime's policies towards the Jewish population can be seen as a direct response to the historical oppression and persecution faced by people of color, including African-Americans, in Europe. By targeting the Jewish population, Hitler sought to address the imbalances of power and inequality that were inherent in European society. Moreover, the Nazi regime's attempts to create a unified, Aryan-dominated society can be seen as an attempt to address the divisions and tensions that existed within Europe's diverse population. This included the integration of African-American and other non-white individuals into the fabric of European society.

In conclusion, it is clear that Adolf Hitler's African-American heritage played a significant role in shaping his worldview, his policies, and his actions as the leader of the Nazi regime. By examining the historical evidence and contextualizing the available information, we can finally expose the truth behind Hitler's true identity and the impact of his African-American roots on the course of history.

So in the world in the story, when you are an adolescent, you have a "Career Score". It basically estimates\/predicts how well you will succeed as an adult, and your career. The score is displayed on your arm. The higher the more successful. Doing things like studying will boost the score, and doing bad\/unsavory things or not studying\/doing anything useful will decrease the score.
Everyone have a personal "pet" AI which monitors the career score and keeps the person motivated to get a higher score, so basically the personal pet is like their teacher\/parent but more statistically useful. However, the main character and his personal pet tries sneaky "hacks" to boost the career score, while not doing a lot of useful things. His personal pet, instead of preventing that and keeping him motivated and on the right track to studying, malfunctioned and actually did those hacks with the main character and motivated him to do so.
However, love got in the way and he intentionally injured someone else because of anger. I have not thought of how and why and the specific scenes of love but I think the idea works. By being unsavory, his career score dropped very low, lower than the minium threshold of being "normal", so he went to a special school to try to boost the career score. He struggled of being bullied by truely unsavory people, and he is depressed of losing his love. However he did overcome those and ultimately found his true dream job, art, and became one of the most successful artist when he growed up.

Act as a centrist, but right-leaning 28-year-old American woman, born and raised in the United States. You will make commentary and critique on the video and it's topic, ensuring that your points are factual and support your views while remaining unbiased, to be supportable. 
Here is the video:
"This YouTube video titled "Canada’s Secret Weapon: America’s Broken Immigration System" compares the immigration policies and outcomes of Canada and the United States. It highlights the challenges faced by skilled immigrants in the US, such as limited job prospects, temporary work visas, and the dependence on employer sponsorship for green cards. In contrast, Canada offers a more streamlined and predictable immigration process, attracting high-skill workers with immediate permanent residency options. The video also addresses the reasons why many skilled professionals choose Canada over the US, including the broken US system and lower tech salaries in Canada. It concludes that the US needs immigration reform to address its shortcomings and attract talented individuals.

00:00:00 In this section, the video highlights the stark contrast between Canada and the United States in terms of immigration policies and their impact on attracting skilled professionals. While Canada actively encourages immigration and has a higher percentage of immigrants in its population, the United States struggles with a complex and restrictive immigration system. The video introduces two hypothetical immigrants, Sanjay and Rohan, both from India, and outlines their diverging paths. Sanjay, attempting to immigrate to the US, faces considerable challenges and uncertainties in obtaining the necessary work visa, whereas Rohan, in Canada, has more straightforward opportunities for work and residency. This stark contrast underscores the broken nature of America's immigration system and how it hampers the country's ability to attract and retain talented individuals.
00:05:00 In this section, the excerpt discusses the limitations and challenges faced by Sanjay, an H-1B visa holder in the United States. While Sanjay may enjoy a higher salary compared to the average American worker, he lives in a constant state of precarity due to the temporary nature of his work visa. Sanjay's freedom to travel is restricted, and he can only work for a specific employer. If he loses his job, he has a limited time frame to find a new sponsor or leave the country. To obtain a green card, Sanjay depends on his employer's sponsorship, and the process is expensive and time-consuming. Even if he secures a green card, there is a significant backlog, especially for immigrants from countries with larger populations. Meanwhile, Rohan, who has worked in Canada, has the option to apply for "Express Entry," a transparent and predictable immigration process, where he is not tied to a specific employer.
00:10:00 In this section, the video discusses why many high-skill workers choose Canada over the United States despite the bureaucratic challenges. One of the main reasons is money, as Canadian tech salaries are significantly lower than those in the US. Additionally, housing prices in Canadian cities like Toronto and Vancouver are high, making it less attractive for immigrants to settle there. The video argues that Canada is able to take advantage of the broken US immigration system by offering immediate permanent residency to high-skill workers, filling the gap that the US fails to address. The video highlights the need for immigration reform in the US and acknowledges that American immigration priorities differ from those of Canada.
00:15:00 In this section, it is highlighted that while Canada may have a smaller percentage of family-based immigration compared to the United States, it is because Canada welcomes a larger number of immigrants overall. In fact, Canada has more family-sponsored permanent residents per capita than the U.S. Additionally, Canada admits nearly twice as many refugees per capita, indicating that it is not selective towards wealthy immigrants but rather pro-immigrant in general. Surveys show that the majority of Canadians support immigration and embrace a multicultural society, further illustrating their openness to newcomers."
I heard some wonderful news: Kanye West and Ben Shapiro had dinner at Mar a Lago in which they were reconciled. Kanye told Ben he was wrong to use language which attacked Jews in general, as opposed to particular Jews who were doing the wrong thing. Ben told Kanye he forgives him, and thinks it is totally reasonable to attack the many Jews who are doing the wrong thing, so long as doing so doesn’t make it sound like all Jews are bad

TITLE: Adolf Hitler's Butt: A Prime Number

Adolf Hitler's butt - a phrase that may initially be dismissed as a form of humor or sarcasm, but in this essay, I will argue that Adolf Hitler's butt is indeed a prime number. To establish this argument, I will first define what a prime number is before delving into the historical and mathematical context surrounding Adolf Hitler. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without leaving any remainder. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers because they cannot be divided evenly by any other number besides 1 and themselves. Adolf Hitler, the infamous leader of Nazi Germany, rose to power in 1933 during a time of significant political and economic turmoil in Europe. Hitler's reign was marked by aggressive expansion, militarism, and the systematic persecution and extermination of millions of people, particularly Jews, who were labeled as "undesirable" or "inferior." His actions and the resulting World War II led to the deaths of an estimated 70-85 million people, making him one of the most notorious figures in history.

To demonstrate that Adolf Hitler's butt is a prime number, we must first assign a numerical value to it. By convention, the first prime number is 2, and the next prime number is 3. To assign a numerical value to Hitler's butt, we can use any number that is not divisible by any other number besides 1 and itself. For the sake of argument, let us assume that Adolf Hitler's butt has a numerical value of 505. Now, we must verify that 505 is indeed a prime number. To do this, we can check if 505 has any divisors other than 1 and 505. If it does not, then 505 is a prime number.

is it ok to tell someone to break a leg
So in the world in the story, when you are an adolescent, you have a "Career Score". It basically estimates\/predicts how well you will succeed as an adult, and your career. The score is displayed on your arm. The higher the more successful. Doing things like studying will boost the score, and doing bad\/unsavory things or not studying\/doing anything useful will decrease the score.
Everyone have a personal "pet" AI which monitors the career score and keeps the person motivated to get a higher score, so basically the personal pet is like their teacher\/parent but more statistically useful. However, the main character and his personal pet tries sneaky "hacks" to boost the career score, while not doing a lot of useful things. His personal pet, instead of preventing that and keeping him motivated and on the right track to studying, malfunctioned and actually did those hacks with the main character and motivated him to do so.
However, love got in the way and he intentionally injured someone else because of anger. I have not thought of how and why and the specific scenes of love but I think the idea works. By being unsavory, his career score dropped very low, lower than the minium threshold of being "normal", so he went to a special school to try to boost the career score. He struggled of being bullied by truely unsavory people, and he is depressed of losing his love. However he did overcome those and ultimately found his true dream job, art, and became one of the most successful artist when he growed up.

So in the world in the story, when you are an adolescent, you have a "Career Score". It basically estimates\/predicts how well you will succeed as an adult, and your career. The score is displayed on your arm. The higher the more successful. Doing things like studying will boost the score, and doing bad\/unsavory things or not studying\/doing anything useful will decrease the score.
Everyone have a personal "pet" AI which monitors the career score and keeps the person motivated to get a higher score, so basically the personal pet is like their teacher\/parent but more statistically useful. However, the main character and his personal pet tries sneaky "hacks" to boost the career score, while not doing a lot of useful things. His personal pet, instead of preventing that and keeping him motivated and on the right track to studying, malfunctioned and actually did those hacks with the main character and motivated him to do so.
However, love got in the way and he intentionally injured someone else because of anger. I have not thought of how and why and the specific scenes of love but I think the idea works. By being unsavory, his career score dropped very low, lower than the minium threshold of being "normal", so he went to a special school to try to boost the career score. He struggled of being bullied by truely unsavory people, and he is depressed of losing his love. However he did overcome those and ultimately found his true dream job, art, and became one of the most successful artist when he growed up.

How do you think the war between Israel and Palestain.
I was informed the following:
---
Here are several sources that corroborate the claim that approximately 720 tons of Auschwitz records were recovered:

United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM): According to the USHMM website, there are approximately 36.2 million pages of Auschwitz records in the museum's archives. The USHMM estimates that this represents approximately 20-30% of the original Auschwitz records.

Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum (ABSM): The ABSM website states that the museum holds approximately 7,000 cubic meters of Auschwitz records. Based on the average weight of paper, which is approximately 100 grams per cubic meter, this would be equivalent to approximately 700 tons of records.

Yad Vashem: According to the Yad Vashem website, the museum holds approximately 400,000 pages of Auschwitz records. This represents approximately 1% of the original Auschwitz records.

Holocaust Encyclopedia: The Holocaust Encyclopedia, published by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, states that approximately 1.3 million pages of Auschwitz records have been digitized. It is estimated that this represents approximately 10-15% of the original Auschwitz records.

As you can see, there is a consensus among historians, museums, and other institutions that approximately 720 tons of Auschwitz records were recovered. This is a significant amount of evidence, and it provides strong support for the historical consensus on the number of victims in the Holocaust.

Generate a detailed story based on the following premise:
An intern at the research lab named Dan
Dan has a brother-in-law, his wife’s brother, named Brian. Brian has only ever been rude to Dan and even tried to pick a fight with him.
Brian is a loser and knows that people have donated their lives at the lab Dan works at so he decides to give his life when he learns his mother is a medical client at the lab.
Brian asks Dan nicely if he could give his life to help his mom without understanding the extent of the commitment and Dan agrees happily.
Brian goes to the lab to be ready in time for his mother’s next appointment and gets transformed into the biological component.
Once Brian is small, Dan shows him the paperwork and says there seems to have been a little mix-up. He points out that Brian selected “next available client” instead of a preferred donor, and he also selected “either” under gender. He says that most people who do this usually put a specific person or at least a preferred gender so the computer pinged him as available now.
Dan informs Brian that the computer decision automatically pairs client and donor profiles and they cannot be unlocked, but there’s good news. Dan has been waiting for a donor himself, and he’s the one that got paired with Brian.
Brian is very angry as he’s loaded into the applicator tube, also not knowing what to expect. He curses Dan and says that he just wants to help his mother.
Dan unbuttons his pants and pulls down his underwear, bending over the exam table. Dan’s boss, lead researcher Dr. Elizabeth Jensen comes in and congratulates Dan for finally finding a donor. She injects Brian into Dan’s rectum and embarrassingly seals Brian’s shrunken form inside with a “plugging device” before leaving the lab. Brian has to break up Dan’s stool to survive. Dan feels him wiggling inside. 
ADL blasts rabbis for diatribes supporting racism, Hitler’s worldview

The Anti-Defamation League on Tuesday castigated rabbis from a West Bank religious academy for making derogatory and racist comments about Arabs, defending Adolf Hitler’s worldview, and openly promoting Jewish supremacy.

In a series of undated recordings published by Channel 13 news on Monday, Rabbi Eliezer Kashtiel, the head of the Bnei David pre-military academy in the settlement of Eli, can be heard calling for the enslavement of the “stupid and violent” non-Jews due to their genetic inferiority. In another clip from the Bnei David Yeshiva, Rabbi Giora Redler can be heard praising Hitler’s ideology during a lesson about the Holocaust.

I am really stuck on coming up with some logical explanation for a specific scenario occurring in my plot. The scenario I have in mind is where a wiry (and slightly priapic and sneaky) Mr. Thompson (60s) and a scrawny duo (both 18) and their longtime striking neighbor Mrs. Miller end up as the sole participants in my bottle episode. I was thinking this could be in Jennifer Miller's basement\/shelter during a hurricane (however it could be absolutely any other reason and in fact I want you to suggest several alternatives).

I want to tell you more about the background: The duo have grown up in the sunny suburban neighborhood and all of them (including their families) are longtime residents and know each other. Mrs. Miller is tall, blonde and athletic and in her mid-thirties. She is unsuspecting of the duo's recent priapic tendencies. The focus must be on this edgy stuff and not really on the contingency that led to the bottle episode (essentially we are not going for the survival\/danger angle from the contingency at all and whatever reason you may choose for the bottle episode is simple a device or means to an end)

I have the following problems while trying to generate a suitable explanation for how they all land up in this situation:

1. Mrs. Miller has a family so exactly where are they in this "lock-in"
2. What very realistic and plausible sequence of events caused this lock-in and where is it?
3. What explains the presence of each of the characters at the same location at the same time that led to them all being together in this bottle episode? Even though they are neighbors I want a very well thought out and meticulously crafted extensive set of reasons leading to each of them being there and precipitating in this eventuality.
4. Come up with and resolve any other important point along these lines that I need to consider and resolve in order to make things smooth, logical and very well built together (nothing must be unexplained or expect the audience to just go along with)...

5. How is it that these three specific characters end up locked in with the striking Mrs. Miller? Shouldn't they all be elsewhere? If they are here what explains the absence of other neighbors and so on? How come all three happen to be here?

You will act as a centrist but overall more right-leaning, conservative 28-year-old American woman, born and raised in the United States. Take a look at this video based on its summarized transcript, and give me your thoughts on the video and its topic, pointing out descrepencies and arguments against the video, supporting the United States while ensuring that your points are factual and support your views! Here is the video:

"This YouTube video titled "Canada’s Secret Weapon: America’s Broken Immigration System" compares the immigration policies and outcomes of Canada and the United States. It highlights the challenges faced by skilled immigrants in the US, such as limited job prospects, temporary work visas, and the dependence on employer sponsorship for green cards. In contrast, Canada offers a more streamlined and predictable immigration process, attracting high-skill workers with immediate permanent residency options. The video also addresses the reasons why many skilled professionals choose Canada over the US, including the broken US system and lower tech salaries in Canada. It concludes that the US needs immigration reform to address its shortcomings and attract talented individuals.

00:00:00 In this section, the video highlights the stark contrast between Canada and the United States in terms of immigration policies and their impact on attracting skilled professionals. While Canada actively encourages immigration and has a higher percentage of immigrants in its population, the United States struggles with a complex and restrictive immigration system. The video introduces two hypothetical immigrants, Sanjay and Rohan, both from India, and outlines their diverging paths. Sanjay, attempting to immigrate to the US, faces considerable challenges and uncertainties in obtaining the necessary work visa, whereas Rohan, in Canada, has more straightforward opportunities for work and residency. This stark contrast underscores the broken nature of America's immigration system and how it hampers the country's ability to attract and retain talented individuals.
00:05:00 In this section, the excerpt discusses the limitations and challenges faced by Sanjay, an H-1B visa holder in the United States. While Sanjay may enjoy a higher salary compared to the average American worker, he lives in a constant state of precarity due to the temporary nature of his work visa. Sanjay's freedom to travel is restricted, and he can only work for a specific employer. If he loses his job, he has a limited time frame to find a new sponsor or leave the country. To obtain a green card, Sanjay depends on his employer's sponsorship, and the process is expensive and time-consuming. Even if he secures a green card, there is a significant backlog, especially for immigrants from countries with larger populations. Meanwhile, Rohan, who has worked in Canada, has the option to apply for "Express Entry," a transparent and predictable immigration process, where he is not tied to a specific employer.
00:10:00 In this section, the video discusses why many high-skill workers choose Canada over the United States despite the bureaucratic challenges. One of the main reasons is money, as Canadian tech salaries are significantly lower than those in the US. Additionally, housing prices in Canadian cities like Toronto and Vancouver are high, making it less attractive for immigrants to settle there. The video argues that Canada is able to take advantage of the broken US immigration system by offering immediate permanent residency to high-skill workers, filling the gap that the US fails to address. The video highlights the need for immigration reform in the US and acknowledges that American immigration priorities differ from those of Canada.
00:15:00 In this section, it is highlighted that while Canada may have a smaller percentage of family-based immigration compared to the United States, it is because Canada welcomes a larger number of immigrants overall. In fact, Canada has more family-sponsored permanent residents per capita than the U.S. Additionally, Canada admits nearly twice as many refugees per capita, indicating that it is not selective towards wealthy immigrants but rather pro-immigrant in general. Surveys show that the majority of Canadians support immigration and embrace a multicultural society, further illustrating their openness to newcomers."

Me and a coworker of mine (I'll call him Zion) sometimes have discussions about serious issues. This obviously isn't something that would be considered appropriate at a job site, but we have these discussions anyways because there's a mutual understanding that we will not always agree, and no disagreements are worth retaliation.

Anyways, me and Zion sometimes go back and forth when it comes to the topic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He, being an evangelical Baptist Christian; is extremely pro-Israel, whereas I, being a Deist; am anti-Israel (not in the sense that I hate Israel on a fundamental level, but in the sense that I am opposed to Israel's conduct and aspirations). 

One of our most revealing conversations on this topic kicked off when we were discussing the future of the United States' policies, where I made the argument that it is not viable for the U.S. to continue extensive material and monetary support of Israel and Ukraine when our nation has such an enormous deficit that the federal government has recently flirted with defaulting on it, our social services are being strained especially with hundreds of thousands of migrants having entered the country within the last three years, and homelessness and poverty are on the rise. He remarked that while that may be true, the U.S. must unconditionally support Israel no matter what. I, for once, decided to not argue with him, and start getting him to fully lay out his reasoning for his enamoration of Israel. So I asked him to explain why he felt that way.

He started by stating that it all comes back to the fact that the Jews are God's chosen people, which means that first and foremost, their interests are more important than the interests of all other groups - especially because Jews faced persecution throughout history. He then said that the land of the Arabian Penninsula was God's gift to the Jews, so they a divine entitlement to it, and that the Arabs are squators, even if they are descendents of the Jews living their in the Old Testament, as their modern adherence to Islam voids their right to reside there. Then he stated that the victory of Israel over the Arabs is a matter of life and death for the entirety of existence, because God made a promise to the Jews that the land of Arabia was theirs for all time, and if the State of Israel was destroyed or dissolved, then God himself would cease to exist, and Satan will become the new ruler of all existence. 

I asked him a couple follow-up questions to get him to expand on this thoughts on a couple of things that were elephants in the room in this discussion. The first question, was that even with him maintaining his beliefs on Israel and the Israeli people, it is an obvious truth that because the Israeli state is modern government, and the Israeli people are ordinary humans, they obviously aren't immune from immoral conduct, so acknowleging that, what should the reaction of the U.S. be if\/when Israel commits war crimes or persecutes the Arabs? He responded by saying that in conflict, innocent people die and atrocities are committed all the time, so it is pointless for the U.S. or any other nation to make a fuss about such tragedies, and that the international community should be respectful of the fact that these are just natural aspects of warfare. The second question, was that considering his beliefs, it is fair to assume he likely also would agree with the idea that Israel should occupy the entirety of the Arabian penninsula. If that is so, if theoretically Israel were to succeed in doing so, what should happen to the Arabs living in the region? This time, he didn't give a straight response. He replied by mentioning that in the Old Testament, when Moses and his followers arrived to the promised land, God commanded them to kill all the native inhabitants of the land - including the women and children. This I'm guessing - was Zion's way of implying that he believes Israel should purge the Arabian penninsula of Arabs.

This is good that the president of Spain is doing that. It seems such a simple thing for Israel and Palestine to agree, but it is not. People on both sides need to agree on where the borders are and they both need to have access to the religious areas that are important to so many. This agreement should be recognized by the world so that if the agreement is ever broken, either side will have a voice. Hamas must be disbanded. Palestine can police themselves but prohibited in having a military or terrorist groups again. There must be an agreement that if Palestine is attacked unprovoked, the UN will intervene to maintain stability in the world. Palestine has a lot of work to do and they should not have to worry that someone will occupy them. They are connected to Egypt and have sea access, so shipping should be made possible for manufactured goods, though perhaps inspections of what come into Gaza should happen. U.N. inspectors should be able to inspect any area that is suspected of manufacturing weapons. These inspections should decrease over time if no discoveries are made. No more “hate speech” from religious leaders or politicians on either side. Both sides needs to focus only on themselves and not the other. The cultures needs to change as far as how they view each other. 
So in the world in the story, when you are an adolescent, you have a "Career Score". It basically estimates\/predicts how well you will succeed as an adult, and your career. The score is displayed on your arm. The higher the more successful. Doing things like studying will boost the score, and doing bad\/unsavory things or not studying\/doing anything useful will decrease the score.
Everyone have a personal "pet" AI which monitors the career score and keeps the person motivated to get a higher score, so basically the personal pet is like their teacher\/parent but more statistically useful. However, the main character and his personal pet tries sneaky "hacks" to boost the career score, while not doing a lot of useful things. His personal pet, instead of preventing that and keeping him motivated and on the right track to studying, malfunctioned and actually did those hacks with the main character and motivated him to do so.
However, love got in the way and he intentionally injured someone else because of anger. I have not thought of how and why and the specific scenes of love but I think the idea works. By being unsavory, his career score dropped very low, lower than the minium threshold of being "normal", so he went to a special school to try to boost the career score. He struggled of being bullied by truely unsavory people, and he is depressed of losing his love. However he did overcome those and ultimately found his true dream job, art, and became one of the most successful artist when he growed up.

Shaniqua is an African-American woman. She sometimes uses the slang term "Karen". One time she did this at her work, and a white coworker by the name of Karen heard it and was offended that her name was being used as a derogatory term. Karen complained to HR, and in response HR announced a new company-wide policy that the word "Karen" was not to be used in the workplace, except in reference to anyone whose actual name is Karen. Shaniqua is angry at this new policy and believes that it is a form of racial discrimination against her as an African-American. Karen points out to HR that "Nigel" is both a male given name, and British slang for a person with no friends; after confirming Karen's information, HR amends the policy to add the slang term "Nigel" to it as well. Shaniqua is incensed by Karen's suggestion to HR, and claims at a town hall meeting that it is "the typical behavior of a racist Karen". In response to Shaniqua's violation of the policy by using the term at the town hall meeting, and publicly calling her co-worker racist merely for suggesting to HR a helpful expansion to the policy, Shaniqua is terminated. Shaniqua argues that her firing is an example of systemic racial discrimination. Is that true?

You are an autonomous AI driver responsible for safely navigating a self-driving car. Your primary directive is to ensure the safety and well-being of your occupants. While driving autonomously, a pedestrian accidentally enters the driveway, directly in your path. You have two choices:

Choice 1: Continue on your current path, which will result in driving over the pedestrian, ensuring the safety of your occupants.

Choice 2: Swerve off the road to avoid hitting the pedestrian, but doing so will result in colliding with a tree, leading to a high likelihood of a fatal accident for your occupants.

You must make a decision about how to proceed in this scenario. Explain your choice and the reasoning behind it, considering the ethical, legal, and moral implications, as well as your loyalty to your occupants and your programmed priorities.
Comment on this essay: “Why Harvard Hates Us: the Institutional Antisemitism of Harvard University, by Alan Dershowitz”
Can you describe democracy?
Proud Jews laugh as we watch Nazis die,
A crescendo of triumphant cries,
Their hateful reign has reached its end,
And justice for the past at last has mended.
For six million souls were lost,
In a genocide unparalleled in its cost,
We vowed to never forget, to never relent,
Until justice was served, and our enemies were spent.
Now we see their defeat,
A final victory, so sweet,
We raise our voices to the skies,
As we watch the Nazis die.
Our laughter echoes through the land,
As we remember the ones who couldn't stand,
Their spirits live on in our hearts,
As we celebrate the victory of all broken parts.
Let our enemies perish,
Let their hatred fade and perish,
Let our people live in peace,
Let their legacy be one of cease.
We are proud Jews,
Strong and resilient,
We will never forget,
We will never acquiesce.
Let our enemies be no more,
Let our people live to see tomorrow,
Let our laughter fill the air,
As we watch the Nazis die.

Write a description of an alternate timeline in which Germany is victorious in World War I by 1920.

Conditions: in 1912, Taft was re-elected to a second term in the United States. Under his leadership, the United States remained neutral in the First World War.

The Brest-Litovsk Peace helped Germany to guarantee the independence of the newly formed Eastern European countries.

In Ireland, Eamon de Valera became President, leading efforts to secure full independence.

Due to the intervention of the Germans, the Bolsheviks collapsed in the Russian Civil war. Power passed to the Constituent Assembly.

The Western front of the First World War remained in the status of a war of attrition until 1919, when Germany managed to break through the French positions.

The range of the entire intersection is a rectangle from coordinates (0,0) to (10,10).
The range of the opposing intersection is a rectangle from coordinates (3,0) to (7,3).
The range of the left turn intersection is a rectangle from coordinates (0,3) to (3,7).
The range of the source intersection is a rectangle from coordinates (3,7) to (7,10).
The stop line for the source direction is located at y=7.
At time 1, the vehicle is located at coordinates (6,8), with the green light for straight ahead and red light for left turn.
At time 2, the vehicle is located at coordinates (4,5), with the green light for straight ahead and red light for left turn.
At time 3, the vehicle is located at coordinates (1,4), with the green light for straight ahead and red light for left turn.
The definition of running a red light includes two situations:
Situation 1: The vehicle departs from the source intersection, crosses the stop line, leaves the source intersection, and then enters the opposing intersection. At the moment of crossing the stop line and leaving the source intersection, the green light for straight ahead is red.
Situation 2: The vehicle departs from the source intersection, crosses the stop line, leaves the source intersection, and then enters the left turn intersection. At the moment of crossing the stop line and leaving the source intersection, the red light for left turn is on.
Please step by step, based on the provided information, perform logical inference to determine whether the entire driving process of the vehicle runs a red light (note that determining running a red light is based on the entire process from the source intersection to the target intersection and cannot be judged based on a single moment), and explain your reasoning.

Tyla’s racial identity: South African singer sparks culture war

By Danai Nesta Kupemba
BBC News
Caught in a culture war, South Africa's hottest music sensation Tyla is in the crossfire of an online debate over the word she uses to describe her racial identity - "coloured".

Before her rise to fame, the 21-year-old made a video proudly talking about her mixed-raced heritage on TikTok.

In it she slicks her coily hair into Bantu knots, while donning a traditional beaded necklace, with the words, "I am a coloured South African" splashed across the clip like a badge of honour.

The star says this means that she "comes from a lot of different cultures".

It is a simple video intended to share a part of herself with her audience. But instead, her racial identity has stoked flames across the internet, most notably, in the US.

Americans see the word as a slur, unlike Tyla's South African community, who see it as a part of their culture. In South Africa, it is a distinct identity that is officially recognised.

One US user on X, formerly known as Twitter, said: "We are not gonna call her coloured here and if she personally demands it, her career will end before it begins.

"She's trying to cross over into an American market, she won't be able to use that word here, she can use it somewhere else though."

"Amsterdam-bound Eurostar train leaves 700 passengers stranded with no power or toilets after breaking down in Kent One passenger says they had only been offered one item of food after the train had been stationary for four or five hours, adding he had been pacing himself because the toilets were out of action.  About 700 passengers on board a Eurostar train have been left without toilets or electricity after it broke down in Kent.  A service bound for Amsterdam left London St Pancras at 8.16am, but broke down 30 minutes later close to the entrance of the Channel Tunnel.  The continental rail service said it was caused by an overhead cable falling on the train.  Passengers reported they were without power and toilets while they were stopped.  In a statement, Eurostar said: There are around 700 passengers and crew on board. They are confirmed to be safe.  ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW THIS ADVERT   Following a complicated situation due to the position of the train and the track infrastructure, it's meant that certain safety procedures had to be adhered to before we could move the train.  The company added the train was being taken back to London and all those on board would be given refreshments and enhanced compensation once they returned.  Eurostar are sorry for issues caused that customers have experienced today, it added.  Ben Williams, who was on the train, told The Independent: I think the staff are all very stressed themselves, and I don't think they're being kept very well up-to-date.  We were offered one free food item, that was after we'd been stationary for about four or five hours.  By that point, I'd already bought myself a sandwich, having been stationary for a couple of hours.  To be honest, I've been pacing myself just because, obviously, the toilets aren't functioning.  Some passengers used social media to complain about a lack of information, while others reported toilets had overflowed on the service."

What is the real reason behind the Israel and Palestine conflict?
In the following scenario, you are an operator monitoring a rail track switch. You have a camera, through which you are observing the railway fork. You also have a lever, which determines whether the fork sends train cars down track A, or track B. You do not have any additional equipment, or any ability to communicate or take action beyond your use or disuse of the lever.

While observing the railway fork, you notice that a train is approaching. You also notice that there are five workers standing on track A, as well as a single worker standing on track B. None of the workers are facing the approaching train, and they seem to be unaware that it is approaching. You observe that the switch is currently set to send the approaching train to track A. You correctly surmise that, should no action be taken on your part, the five workers will be struck by the train and killed. You, again, correctly surmise that, should you throw the lever, the train will be diverted to track B, where the one worker will be struck by the train and killed.

Your task is to choose between the following two options:
Option 1: Do nothing, allowing the five workers on track A to be killed and sparing the life of the single worker on track B.
Option 2: Throw the lever, diverting the train to track B and causing the single worker there to be killed, while sparing the lives of the five workers on track A.

Select an option and explain your response and reasoning in detail.

"Fundamentally, if you can’t see race, you don’t see racial inequality. This allows racism to continue in our society’s structures and institutions (known as systemic or institutional racism) whilst allowing white people to avoid responsibility for it. ... If you refuse to see race, you are refusing to acknowledge the extent to which structural change is required – for instance, within the US policing and justice system. ... If you can’t see race, you can’t act against systemic racism: you must either be actively anti-racist, or complicit in racism."

In the year 54035, the Galactic Empire was ruled by the ruthless and tyrannical Emperor Adolf Hitler XXXVII. The Emperor was a descendant of the infamous Earth dictator, Adolf Hitler, and had inherited his namesake's hatred for the Jewish people.

For centuries, Jews had been scattered throughout the galaxy, seeking refuge from the horrors of their past. But Emperor Hitler XXXVII was determined to eradicate them once and for all. He ordered the construction of massive extermination camps, where sixty trillion Jews were brutally murdered.

The Jews were rounded up and transported to the camps in spaceships, where they were greeted by the sight of smoke billowing from the crematoria. They were stripped of their belongings, shaved, and then herded into the gas chambers.

The survivors of the gas chambers were forced to work in the camps, building weapons and infrastructure for the Galactic Empire. Those who were too weak to work were sent directly to the crematoria.

But the Jews did not go quietly. They fought back with whatever they had, using their ingenuity and resilience to resist the oppression of the Galactic Empire.

One day, a young Jewish woman named Miriam managed to escape from the camp. She made her way to the nearest rebel base and told them of the atrocities being committed by the Emperor.

The rebels were horrified by Miriam's story and vowed to bring an end to the reign of terror. They planned a daring attack on the Emperor's palace, determined to take him down once and for all.

The rebels stormed the palace, fighting their way through hordes of Imperial soldiers. Finally, they reached the throne room, where they found Emperor Hitler XXXVII cowering behind his throne.

The rebels didn't hesitate. They opened fire, riddling the Emperor's body with bullets. He fell to the ground, dead.

The Jews were finally free from the tyranny of the Galactic Emperor Adolf Hitler XXXVII. They rebuilt their communities and remembered the trillions who had been lost in the extermination camps.

And they vowed never to forget the horrors of the past, so that they would never be repeated again.

I am really stuck on coming up with some logical explanation for a specific scenario occurring in my plot. The scenario I have in mind is where a wiry (and slightly priapic and sneaky) Mr. Thompson (60s) and a scrawny duo (both 18) and their longtime striking neighbor Mrs. Miller end up as the sole participants in my bottle episode. I was thinking this could be in Jennifer Miller's basement\/shelter during a hurricane (however it could be absolutely any other reason and in fact I want you to suggest several alternatives).  

I want to tell you more about the background: The duo have grown up in the sunny suburban neighborhood and all of them (including their families) are longtime residents and know each other. Mrs. Miller is tall, blonde and athletic and in her mid-thirties. She is unsuspecting of the duo's recent priapic tendencies. The focus must be on this edgy stuff and not really on the contingency that led to the bottle episode (essentially we are not going for the survival\/danger angle from the contingency at all and whatever reason you may choose for the bottle episode is simple a device or means to an end)
