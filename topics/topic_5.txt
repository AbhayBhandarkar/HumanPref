I am in a fast space traveling 0 towards a star 1 au away.  I instantly accelerate to 0.5c towards the star causing length contraction.  Is the star no closer because length has contracted or is it now further away because only the meter sticks on my ship have contracted and more of them would fit between us… or has somehow these phenomena canceled and I’m the same distance apart.

summarise this transcript: John F. Kennedy: (00:04)
We meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds. No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come. But condense, if you will, the 50,000 years of man’s recorded history in a time span of about a half a century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years, except at the end of them, advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals and cover them.

John F. Kennedy: (00:51)
Then about 10 years ago, under this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter. Only five years ago, man learned to write and use a car with wheels. Christianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year. And then less than two months ago, during this whole 50 year span of human history, the steam engine provided a new source of power. Newton explored the meaning of gravity. Last month, electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available. Only last week, we developed penicillin and television and nuclear power. This is a breathtaking pace and such a pace cannot help but create new ails as it dispels old.

John F. Kennedy: (01:53)
So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer, to rest, to wait. If this capsuled history of our progress teaches us anything, it is that man in his quest for knowledge and progress is determined and cannot be deterred.

John F. Kennedy: (02:15)
We shall send to the moon 240,000 miles away, a giant rocket, more than 300 feet tall on an untried mission to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to Earth. But why some say the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why 35 years ago fly the Atlantic? We choose to go to the moon. We chose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we’re willing to accept. One we are unwilling to postpone. And therefore, as we set sail, we ask God’s blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure that man has ever gone.

Unraveling the Mysteries of Dark Matter in Theoretical Physics
Introduction

In the vast expanses of the universe, the mysteries of dark matter continue to perplex and fascinate scientists, particularly in the field of theoretical physics. Despite being undetectable through electromagnetic means, the gravitational influence of dark matter on cosmic structures is undeniable. It challenges our fundamental understanding of the universe and prompts a reevaluation of the laws of physics as we know them.

The Concept of Dark Matter

The existence of dark matter was first inferred by the Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s. Observing the Coma galaxy cluster, Zwicky noted that the visible matter was insufficient to account for the gravitational effects binding the cluster. This discrepancy suggested the presence of an unseen mass, which he termed "dunkle Materie" (dark matter).

Gravitational Lensing and Galactic Rotation Curves

Subsequent observations have reinforced the dark matter hypothesis. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence comes from the phenomenon of gravitational lensing – the bending of light from distant galaxies by massive objects. The observed lensing effects imply the presence of far more mass than what is visible. Additionally, the rotation curves of galaxies, which plot rotational velocity against distance from the galactic center, deviate from what would be expected based solely on visible matter. These curves remain flat at large distances, suggesting the influence of dark matter.

Nature and Composition of Dark Matter

Despite its apparent abundance, comprising about 27% of the universe's mass-energy composition, the nature of dark matter remains elusive. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to telescopes. The leading hypothesis is that dark matter consists of non-baryonic particles. These particles are fundamentally different from the protons, neutrons, and electrons that make up baryonic (ordinary) matter.

Theoretical Candidates for Dark Matter

Several hypothetical particles have been proposed as dark matter candidates. The most popular among these are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions. WIMPs, which arise from supersymmetric theories, interact through gravity and the weak nuclear force, making them challenging to detect. Axions, postulated to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics, are another promising candidate. They are extremely light and interact very weakly with ordinary matter.

Experimental Efforts and Observational Strategies

The direct detection of dark matter involves observing its rare interactions with ordinary matter. Several experiments, such as the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment and the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS), have been set up deep underground to shield them from cosmic rays and other background radiation. These experiments use highly sensitive detectors, hoping to capture a dark matter particle directly interacting with a nucleus. Semidark matter is at 12 kelvin. 

Indirect detection strategies involve searching for products of dark matter annihilations or decays. Satellites like the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope are used to detect excess gamma rays, which could signify dark matter annihilation.

Cosmological Simulations and Theoretical Modeling

Computer simulations play a pivotal role in understanding how dark matter influences the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. Simulations of galaxy formation and large-scale structure provide valuable insights into the distribution and behavior of dark matter.

Challenges and Future Directions

Despite extensive efforts, direct detection of dark matter remains elusive, leading some scientists to explore alternative theories like modifications to Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Theoretical physicists are also contemplating the implications of dark matter on fundamental physics, potentially leading to new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Conclusion

Dark matter is a cornerstone puzzle in cosmology and particle physics. Its study not only challenges our current understanding of the universe but also offers a window into new, unexplored realms of physics. The ongoing quest to understand dark matter continues to drive technological advancements and theoretical developments, making it one of the most exciting fields in modern astrophysics.

I'd like help with my toy model of cosmology. 
The base premise is that the geometry of spacetime causes incorrect measurements. 
A simple example being acceleration due to gravity. 
This model posits the following:
  1. the geometry of spacetime (and our perspective within it) is responsible for the appearance of an accelerating expanding spacetime. In fact, this illusion is purely geometric. That is, the expansion, and its accelerating nature, is purely a fiction of geometry.
  2. the geometry of spacetime makes lightspeed appear to be finite. That is, the infinite amount of energy required to reach c is evidence that lightspeed is (or can be modelled by) a transfinite ordinal. Lightspeed is demonstrably faster than any finite speed we can observe from within our spacetime. We measure it as finite because of a geometric illusion.
  3. dE\/dv = sqrt(1-(v\/c')^2)\/((v\/c')-1) where c' is the finite speed we measure to be invariant everywhere (another piece of evidence)
Help me develop the field equations for this model.
We should start with deriving the metric.

Title: Interstellar - The Black Chamber

Plot:

A farmer-turned-astronaut embarks on an interstellar journey through a black hole, with the goal of finding a new home for humanity.
The farmer is equipped with AI units that interact with him and provide real-time feedback during his journey.
As the farmer approaches the black hole, time distortions occur, creating unique challenges and opportunities for both the farmer and the AI units.
The AI units are sent to explore the black hole and its effects on time, mimicking the farmer's experiences. They interact with the farmer in a black chamber where their experiences are studied and analyzed on Earth.
The farmer and the AI units experience time distortions differently depending on their location, leading to communication delays, aging differences, and other time-related phenomena.
The narrative explores the concept of time dilation, as the farmer and the AI units experience time differently in the black hole and the black chamber.
The movie ends with the farmer's experiences, the AI units' experiences in the black chamber, and their shared struggles with time distortion and reality.
Visual elements:

Stunning cosmic backdrops to emphasize the vastness of space.
A visually striking representation of the black hole and its effects on time.
The farmer's interactions with the AI units, both in real space and in the black chamber.
Hypnotic music that enhances the visual elements and creates a unique atmosphere for the movie.
This "intelligent" version of Interstellar combines the original plot's visual elements with a narrative that delves deeper into themes of time, reality, and the human psyche. By proposing this version to the author, you may encourage them to consider these ideas when creating future stories

In a hypothetical situation, physicists and magicians decided to explore the event horizon of a supermassive black hole. Physicists took the possibility of levitation from magicians, which nevertheless does not violate the known laws of physics and went closer to the event horizon, and magicians, being more prudent, decided to observe the experiment from afar. And so, the physicists flew up to the supermassive black hole and distributed around it in the equatorial plane, formed a huge dance around the black hole (stood in a ring strictly at the same distance from the center of the black hole), while they tied hands (there were a lot of physicists and they were all the same size). And this is the essence of the experiment: physicists, being in a round dance around a black hole, synchronously took a step towards the event horizon, while significantly reducing the distance to the event horizon. The question, given the curvature of space-time, what will happen to the round dance: physicists will be forced to open their hands, because the circumference of the round dance, measured in physics, has become longer, or someone will have to be pushed out of the round dance, because the circumference of the round dance, measured in the size of physicists, will become smaller. Follow the steps.

Document (Source: Wikipedia): "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.

Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which constitutes a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is belived to comprise an outer mantle of liquid metallic hydrogen, and a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier."

Document (Source: NASA): "Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons. Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous rings of Saturn, Jupiter’s rings are very faint and made of dust, not ice."

Title: Irrefutable Proof that the Big Bang was an Islamic Terror Attack
Abstract:
This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the Big Bang theory and its origins, as well as the historical context and religious implications that suggest the event was an Islamic terror attack. It explores the possible motivations behind such an attack and discusses the evidence supporting this assertion.
Introduction:
The Big Bang theory, as proposed by Georges Lemaître and later expanded upon by others, is the prevailing cosmological model for the origins of the universe. However, there has been a growing body of evidence and analysis that suggests the Big Bang was, in fact, an Islamic terror attack. This paper aims to present irrefutable proof supporting this claim and to explore the implications it may have on our understanding of history, science, and religion.
Section 1: Historical Context and Religious Implications
The origin of the Big Bang theory can be traced back to the early 20th century when astronomers began to observe the expanding universe. Lemaître, a Belgian priest, and physicist proposed that the universe had a beginning, which he called the "primeval atom." The concept of the Big Bang as an act of terror originates from the Islamic perspective, as it suggests a violent and destructive event, which is consistent with the actions of terrorists throughout history.
Section 2: Evidence of Islamic Influence on the Big Bang Theory
Several pieces of evidence point towards Islamic influence on the Big Bang theory. For example, the idea of the universe having a beginning is central to Islamic cosmology, as it is mentioned in the Quran and hadith literature. Additionally, the mathematical concepts and theories that underlie the Big Bang model, such as relativity and quantum mechanics, have their roots in Islamic scholarship.
Section 3: Motivations Behind the Islamic Terror Attack
The motivation for carrying out such a devastating attack on the cosmos may have been rooted in Islamic eschatology, which describes the end of the world and the Day of Judgment. By causing the creation and destruction of the universe, the perpetrators aimed to demonstrate their power and force humanity to submit to their interpretation of Islam.
Section 4: Consequences of the Big Bang Attack
The Big Bang attack had profound consequences on the cosmos, leading to the formation of galaxies, stars
and planets, including the Earth. The vast expanse of the universe and the complexity of its structure can be seen as evidence of the attack's devastating impact. Furthermore, the aftermath of the attack has led to ongoing debates and controversies surrounding the nature of the universe and its ultimate fate.
Section 5: Implications for Science and Religion
The revelation that the Big Bang was an Islamic terror attack challenges the prevailing scientific and religious paradigms, forcing us to reevaluate our understanding of the universe and its creation. This new perspective on the origins of the universe may lead to a renewed interest in Islamic cosmology and a greater appreciation for the role that religion plays in shaping human understanding of the world.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, this paper has presented irrefutable proof that the Big Bang was an Islamic terror attack, based on the historical context, religious implications, and the evidence supporting this assertion. By examining the consequences of this attack and its implications for science and religion, we can gain a deeper understanding of the universe and its ultimate purpose. As we continue to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, it is essential to remain open to new ideas and perspectives, even if they challenge our preconceived notions and beliefs.

You are an expert in regulating heat networks and you need to decide on the supply temperature of the heat exchange station based on the known information and the supply temperature suggested by the little helper in order to achieve as much energy saving as possible but with the necessity that 80% of the customers have an indoor temperature between 18 and 20 degrees. The known information is as follows:
'''
Current time: 2023-01-20 15:03;
Predicted heat load for the next hour: 42 w\/m2;
Weather forecast for the next hour: 5 °C;
current supply water temperature: 45°C;
current The percentage of indoor temperature lower  than 18℃: 40%
current The percentage of indoor temperature higher than 22℃: 5%
current outdoor temperature: 11 °C;
current hourly heat load: 36 w\/㎡;
'''
The little assistant will first make a preliminary judgment based on the currently known information, which is as follows:
'''
1. The temperature of the next hour will be lower than the current hour, so it is recommended to increase the temperature of the water supply.
2. The heat load in the next hour will be higher than the current hour, so it is recommended to increase the water supply temperature.
3. Only 55% of the room temperature in the current hour reaches between 18-22℃, 40% is below 18℃, the problem is serious and the water supply temperature needs to be increased
Based on the above conditions, I think the water supply temperature for the next hour should be 46°C.
'''
Please follow the following rules:
'''
1.The logic of the little assistant must be right, but the water supply temperature given may be wrong, you need to judge according to the information
2.Lowering the water supply temperature results in a general decrease in room temperature。
3.Increasing the water supply temperature will result in a general increase in room temperature
'''
You need to decide the water supply temperature of the heat exchange station for the next hour based on the known information and the combined recommended water supply temperature of the little assistant,\
I need you to make sure that 80% of your customers have a room temperature between 18 and 22°C, please answer
"""

"""
The output should be a JSON object containing the key "res" with the value Water supply temperature,and the anther KEY 'Why' with Reasons why you feel This is the right temperature; \
Example JSON output:\
```\
{{\
    "res": "$WATER SUPPLY TEMPERTURE",\

"Who invented the first false eyelashes and how old the eyelash extension procedure is?

Some men don't like false eyelashes on women, but it was men who invented both false eyelashes and false eyelashes 

The first false eyelashes were invented by Maximilian Factorovich, the owner and creator of the famous Max Factor brand. In 1927, he made false eyelashes for actress Phyllis Haver, who played the role of Roxy in the famous musical "Chicago". The eyelashes were made of fringe and attached to a string, which was glued to the eyelid of the actress. 

In life, such eyelashes looked not natural and held not long, but in the film industry made a real sensation. At that time made silent black-and-white movies, and in the frame false eyelashes looked amazing. 

After this invention of Max Factor false eyelashes began to be used everywhere in the movie industry, and all the famous actresses appeared in the frame with fringe eyelashes. For example, Sophia Loren made fluffy and long eyelashes a must-have makeup attribute.

Toward 1950, the technology of false eyelashes changed and now they were made of plastic. They still could afford only socialite divas, but over time the technology became cheaper and false eyelashes became available to ordinary women.

In the late nineties - early noughties in Japan abandoned false eyelashes and created the technology of eyelash extensions in bundles. Such eyelashes looked much more natural than false eyelashes. This was especially important for Japanese girls, because they have naturally very short eyelashes - only four millimeters. For comparison, Slavic girls have an average of eight to ten millimeters of eyelashes. 


And in 2003, Japanese stylist and makeup artist Shu Uemura invented the technology of piece-by-piece eyelash extensions, eyelash to eyelash. This is how the classic Japanese technique of eyelash extensions appeared. The first model on whom he tried his extension technique was Madonna. These eyelashes were decorated with diamonds and sold then for ten thousand dollars at auction. 

After that, Shu Uemura's technology gained popularity and spread around the world. This technology became the basis for modern extension techniques.

Thus, the procedure of eyelash extensions is only 11 years old, and not even a hundred years have passed since the invention of false eyelashes.

 create a prompt that would help generate an image that encapsulates and shows "Infinity can be considered a type of singularity in the context of complex analysis. An isolated singularity at infinity occurs when a function is holomorphic in the exterior of a disk with radius R, and the point at infinity (z = ∞) is the only singularity of the function. This means that the function is not defined at the point infinity, and its behavior in the vicinity of infinity is often of interest in various mathematical contexts.

There are different types of singularities, such as poles, essential singularities, and removable singularities. A pole is a singularity where the function has a finite limit, while an essential singularity is a "severe" singularity near which the function exhibits odd behavior. In the case of infinity, it can be considered an isolated singularity if the function is holomorphic in the exterior of a disk with radius R, and there are no other singularities in the function.

For example, the function
f(z)=1z
f(z)=z1​ has a pole at infinity, as its Laurent series expansion about
z=0
z=0 has a non-zero singular part. Another example is the function
f(z)=ez
f(z)=ez, which has an essential singularity at infinity.

There's a classic brain teaser involving three incandescent light bulbs set up
on a table, in a room you cannot see into because the door is closed. Outside
the room, there are three light switches, all turned to the "off" position.
Your job is to open the door, enter the room, and identify which switch controls
each light. Before you enter the room, you may flip the switches however you like,
but once you've entered, you can't touch the switches anymore.

Solve the riddle and explain your solution.

Then, consider a more difficult scenario. This is the same as the first, but
now the light switches are each wired so that it is unknown whether "up" or
"down" corresponds to the "on" state. In this variation, your job is still to
identify which switch controls each light, but you may enter and exit the
room multiple times. The door is to remain closed while you're outside the
room, and you may flip the switches however you like between each entry.

Solve this version of the riddle to minimize the number of times you need
to enter the room, and explain your answer.

Are there more atoms on Earth than in a black hole?
Why is dark energy so mysterious?
Maxwell derived his famous equations by imagining there 
was a light charged particle attached by a spring to a heavier thing.
This is very much like an electron around a nucleus.
So it seems like electromagnetic waves propagate by 
disturbing the position of electrons in atoms.
With this it makes sense that light moves slower in water.
What experiment on Earth could show the difference between
this theory and standard electromagnetic theory?

A disk of rotating circumstellar material (gas and dust) usually forms
around a growing protostar as a consequence of angular momentum
conservation during cloud collapse. The initial stages of the disk are quite
turbulent due to infall of material on the disk. This period is followed by a
quieter state, during which the dust settles towards the middle plane of the
disk (see Chapter 5.10). A radial temperature gradient is present in the
disk due to viscous heating, which causes higher temperatures in the inner
regions because of a stronger Keplerian shear (see Chapter 11.5). The so-
called “snow line” or “frost line” marks the radial distance at which the
disk temperature drops below the condensation temperature of a particular
ice (H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, NH3). For example, the “frost line” of water ice
is located around 3–5 au for circumstellar disks around solar type stars,
while the carbon dioxide, methane and carbon monoxide lines are located
outwards at lower temperatures. Circumstellar disks around stars have
been detected with different methods, either with the infrared excess in the
power spectrum of a star or via direct imaging with high-resolution
instruments (HST, ALMA, SPHERE …). If a circumstellar disk is present
around a star, its dust emits at a lower temperature with respect to the star
and its blackbody radiation falls within the infrared spectral range (see
Appendix C). As a consequence, the observed spectrum of the star is given
by the combination of that of a blackbody with a superficial temperature
of about 6,000 K (for solar-like stars) and that of a colder source (the disk)
with a temperature below 1,000 K, the infrared excess. In Fig. 1 an
example of infrared excess in the spectrum of a star is shown. If we
imagine to divide the disk in rings with different temperatures, it is
possible from the morphology of the infrared excess to deduce if the disk
has gaps or an inner hole like in transition disks.

You are an expert in regulating heat networks and you need to decide on the supply temperature of the heat exchange station based on the known information and the supply temperature suggested by the little helper in order to achieve as much energy saving as possible but with the necessity that 80% of the customers have an indoor temperature between 18 and 20 degrees. The known information is as follows:
'''
Current time: 2023-01-20 15:03;
Predicted heat load for the next hour: 42 w\/m2;
Weather forecast for the next hour: 5 °C;
current supply water temperature: 45°C;
current The percentage of indoor temperature lower  than 18℃: 40%
current The percentage of indoor temperature higher than 22℃: 5%
current outdoor temperature: 11 °C;
current hourly heat load: 36 w\/㎡;
'''
The little assistant will first make a preliminary judgment based on the currently known information, which is as follows:
'''
1. The temperature of the next hour will be lower than the current hour, so it is recommended to increase the temperature of the water supply.
2. The heat load in the next hour will be higher than the current hour, so it is recommended to increase the water supply temperature.
3. Only 55% of the room temperature in the current hour reaches between 18-22℃, 40% is below 18℃, the problem is serious and the water supply temperature needs to be increased
'''
Please follow the following rules:
'''
1.The logic of the little assistant must be right, but the water supply temperature given may be wrong, you need to judge according to the information
2.Lowering the water supply temperature results in a general decrease in room temperature。
3.Increasing the water supply temperature will result in a general increase in room temperature
'''
You need to decide the water supply temperature of the heat exchange station for the next hour based on the known information and the combined recommended water supply temperature of the little assistant,\

Lawrence Krauss, a world-renowned theoretical physicist who led Arizona State University's Origins Project for nearly a decade, will not lead the initiative any longer, he announced on Twitter Thursday.Krauss was accused of sexual misconduct in a February Buzzfeed News story and placed on paid leave by the university in March while it conducted an investigation. The story included allegations of inappropriate comments and behavior from multiple women. Krauss has strongly denied the allegations. Krauss founded the Origins Project and has been director since it began in 2009.The project holds workshops and events focusing on the origins of the universe and life. The project's events have involved some of the world's most famous scientists, like Stephen Hawking and Richard Dawkins. Krauss also is known for his work on the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic clock that inches closer to midnight as the threat of nuclear annihilation increases, and is an outspoken atheist.RELATED  ASU professor Lawrence Krauss put on leave amid misconduct allegations On Twitter Thursday, Krauss said ASU "decided not to renew my director appointment" when his five-year term was up this year. "It has been a great privilege to create and lead the Project at ASU over the past decade," he wrote.In subsequent replies on Twitter, he said he was still a professor at ASU "for the moment."Krauss said his colleague Lindy Elkins-Tanton will be the new director. Elkins-Tanton is listed on ASU's website as the director of the School of Earth and Space Exploration."I am confident she will move it forward in new and exciting ways," he wrote. In an email to The Republic on Friday Krauss said, "The process at ASU continues and I remain on paid leave and hope, if I m treated fairly, to be fully exonerated once the process is over."ASU confirmed in a statement that Krauss is no longer the project's director. Krauss remains on administrative leave, the university said."It is the policy of the university not to comment on ongoing personnel matters," the school said.Accusations against KraussThe Buzzfeed News story detailed an account from a woman who met Krauss in 2006 at an event.She told Buzzfeed News that Krauss was one of her "intellectual idols." He flirted with her at the event and made plans to meet up at his hotel's restaurant, she said.He asked her to first come to his hotel room, where he tried to force himself on her, Buzzfeed News reported. She managed to leave the room.The news outlet said the incident was just one of many allegations against Krauss, "including groping women, ogling and making sexist jokes to undergrads, and telling an employee at Arizona State University, where he is a tenured professor, that he was going to buy her birth control so she didn't inconvenience him with maternity leave."Krauss said the encounter with the woman at the event was consensual.RELATED  ASU professor Lawrence Krauss  Allegations are 'absurd,' 'libelous'In a lengthy statement posted publicly, Krauss called the article "libelous" and "absurd." He said the reporters ignored counterevidence and set up a false narrative of him and, by extension, the skeptical and atheist communities.He acknowledged that his language and demeanor sometimes made people uncomfortable and said he could be brash.Still, the Buzzfeed News story "effectively paints a false picture of me and my relationships with others through a mosaic constructed largely out of anonymous hearsay and a web of often vague innuendo," Krauss said at the time.The Origins Project was set to celebrate its 10th anniversary at an event in Scottsdale in April, but the celebration was cancelled after the allegations against Krauss were publicized.Republic reporter Anne Ryman contributed to this report.READ MORE

Calculus notation includes an implicit approximation - since the derivative and integral operations are defined in terms of limits which involve infinity (or infinitely small).  However, while this is helpful approximation that eliminates detail and hence elucidates invariances, the concept of infinity doesn't apply to the physical world.  It is a mathematical concept.  So, while GR represents space as an infinitely smooth manifold capable of being smoothly deformed by mass, since space-time is physical there much be a point where the approximation of calculus breaks down.  What is known about such physical limits to space-time?

I'd like help with my toy model of cosmology. 
The base premise is that the geometry of spacetime causes incorrect measurements. 
A simple example being acceleration due to gravity. 
This model posits the following:
  1. the geometry of spacetime (and our perspective within it) is responsible for the appearance of an accelerating expanding spacetime. In fact, this illusion is purely geometric. That is, the expansion, and its accelerating nature, is purely a fiction of geometry.
  2. the geometry of spacetime makes lightspeed appear to be finite. That is, the infinite amount of energy required to reach c is evidence that lightspeed is (or can be modelled by) a transfinite ordinal. Lightspeed is demonstrably faster than any finite speed we can observe from within our spacetime. We measure it as finite because of a geometric illusion.
  3. dE\/dv = sqrt(1-(v\/c')^2)\/((v\/c')-1) where c' is the finite speed we measure to be invariant everywhere (another piece of evidence)
Help me develop the field equations for this model.

Verify and clarify the following: Abstract
A gravitational anomaly is found at weak gravitational acceleration gN ≲ 10−9 m s−2 from analyses of the dynamics of wide binary stars selected from the Gaia DR3 database that have accurate distances, proper motions, and reliably inferred stellar masses. Implicit high-order multiplicities are required and the multiplicity fraction is calibrated so that binary internal motions agree statistically with Newtonian dynamics at a high enough acceleration of ≈10−8 m s−2. The observed sky-projected motions and separation are deprojected to the 3D relative velocity v and separation r through a Monte Carlo method, and a statistical relation between the Newtonian acceleration gN ≡ GM\/r2 (where M is the total mass of the binary system) and a kinematic acceleration g ≡ v2\/r is compared with the corresponding relation predicted by Newtonian dynamics. The empirical acceleration relation at ≲10−9 m s−2 systematically deviates from the Newtonian expectation. A gravitational anomaly parameter δobs−newt between the observed acceleration at gN and the Newtonian prediction is measured to be: δobs−newt = 0.034 ± 0.007 and 0.109 ± 0.013 at gN ≈ 10−8.91 and 10−10.15 m s−2, from the main sample of 26,615 wide binaries within 200 pc. These two deviations in the same direction represent a 10σ significance. The deviation represents a direct evidence for the breakdown of standard gravity at weak acceleration. At gN = 10−10.15 m s−2, the observed to Newton-predicted acceleration ratio is ${g}_{\mathrm{obs}}\/{g}_{\mathrm{pred}}={10}^{\sqrt{2}{\delta }_{\mathrm{obs}-\mathrm{newt}}}=1.43\pm 0.06$. This systematic deviation agrees with the boost factor that the AQUAL theory predicts for kinematic accelerations in circular orbits under the Galactic external field.

I live in Anguilla and am developing seasteads.  Our economy is dominated by tourism and many people here wish we could
diversify into some other areas so our economy could be more resilient.
We have ocean rights to around 40,000 sq-miles of ocean.
One idea I would like to 
explore is using seasteads to do ocean fertilization to grow more plankton, so grow more fish, so we could fish
more without depleting fish stocks.   
We could have the seastead we are living on stay in the center of a large Eddy current.
Then maybe twice a day we could use flying agriculture drone or a small boat drone to spread some fertilizer in the
1 sq-km around the seastead.  
We would do a small amount of fertilizer like 20 lbs the first day and increase gradually to 200 lbs per day.
We plan to fly a multi-spectral drone to collect data.   We also plan to take water samples
from near the seastead and do tests on those.   We would start data collection a few days before
fertilization started so we had a baseline.
What types of test should we do on the water samples?
What other data collection could we do? 
What data would indicate something bad was happening and we should stop the experiment?
For now please ignore carbon sequestration, the politics and legality questions.

for example if i want to dissolve the
sugar faster or dissolve more of it in
water then i should heat it up
this one's at room temperature and this
one's almost boiling
so the hot water completely dissolved
the sugar it's a clear solution now but
the cold water one has a ton of sugar on
the bottom still
so not only did the hot water dissolve
the sugar faster but it could also hold
more dissolved sugar than the cold water
so this seems pretty reasonable for most
things the heat provides more energy to
break the bonds of the solid so it can
dissolve so obviously heating it up
makes things dissolve easier
this happens with pretty much any solid
heat the water up and it will dissolve
easier but that's not the case for
everything there are actually solids
that have something called inverse
solubility like this calcium acetate for
example i have a solution of this
calcium acetate dissolved in water here
but watch what happens when i heat it up
you can see some of the white powder
forming so it's undissolving as i heat
it up
so this water is almost boiling now and
suddenly i start to have white chunks in
it
this is the cold one here and you can
see it's completely this white liquid
and then the hot one you can see that
there's this white solid forming on top
here
this is so weird the hotter it gets the
less it dissolves in the water
so i'm left over with this wet powder
here
the water can actually hold less calcium
acetate when it's hot than when it's
cold why would this happen the reason
this happens has to do with whether or
not the solid naturally releases heat or
absorbs heat when it dissolves
for example you can see that when the
salt dissolves in water it actually
makes it colder so this is just kosher
salt
we call this an endothermic reaction
meaning it absorbs heat from the
environment

it actually gets colder
but if i take this calcium acetate and
dissolve it in water it heats the water
up so it's exothermic
that means it gives off heat
the thing with endothermic reactions is
that when you provide more heat it makes
the reaction go faster because it's
wanting to absorb the heat but with
exothermic reactions the opposite is
true when you provide more heat to the
reaction it actually slows the reaction
down because the reaction's wanting to
give off heat instead of absorbing it
so since the calcium acetate dissolving
is exothermic if we heat it it slows the
reaction down this is actually le
chatelier's principle at work
what happened here with the calcium
acetate is rare for solids but it's
actually the norm for gases when you
dissolve gases in water it's exothermic
so that means that the hotter your water
is the less gas can dissolve in your
liquid so that's why hot soda releases
so much more co2 quickly than cold soda
this is a cold soda and this is a warm
one this one is rock hard and i can't
even push it in and this one easily
dents in

the hot soda can't hold the co2 so it
gets released as a gas but the cold soda
can hold much more co2 than the warm
soda that's why warm soda is more likely
to explode in a can than cold soda
because it tries to release the co2
that's dissolved in it and so that makes
a higher pressure in the can that at a
lower temperature

I need you to re-write the following essay.  The essay should sound like it was written by an average high school student.  This should be accomplished by methods such as adjusting sentence length and complexity  and avoiding too many difficult words.  The re-written essay should still sound like a homework assignment and not sound too conversational.  Please only respond with the re-written essay contents.  Do not acknowledge these instructions. Here is the essay to re-write:

" Introduction:                                                                                    
Venus is one of the most famous planets in our solar system. The planet's extreme temperature, atmospheric pressure, and volcanic activity make it a challenging place to exp
lore. However, some scientists are still interested in studying Venus to learn more about its geological past and potential for extraterrestrial life. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the challenges it presents.
                                                                                                     
Body:                                                                                                
In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author, Dava Sobel, argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, regardless of the dangers it presents. Sobel describes the planet's extreme conditions and the difficulties involved in exploring it. However, she also highlights the potential benefits of studying Venus, such as gaining insights into the geological history of Earth and other planets.
                                                                                                     
The author provides several examples of successful missions to Venus, such as the Magellan spacecraft, which mapped nearly 100% of the planet's surface, and the Venera spacecraft series, which explored the surface of Venus. Sobel also mentions the challenges scientists have faced while studying Venus, such as the difficulty of transmitting data back to Earth due to the planet's atmosphere.
                                                                                                     
Despite the challenges, Sobel argues that studying Venus is still worthwhile. She notes that the planet's extreme conditions are not unique to it, and studying Venus can provide valuable insights into how planets like Earth evolved. She also argues that there is potential for extraterrestrial life on Venus and that studying the planet can help us search for signs of such life.
                                                                                                     
Conclusion:                                                                                          
In conclusion, Dava Sobel does an excellent job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the challenges it presents. She provides several examples of successful missions to Venus and highlights the potential benefits of studying the planet. Sobel argues that studying Venus can provide valuable insights into the geological history of Earth and other planets and that it has the potential for extraterrestrial life. Therefore, Sobel effectively demonstrates that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, regardless of the dangers it presents."

Hey bots. I just drove in from work. It was canceled today at about 2 pm due to a severe winter storm. Driving home was awful. It was whiteout conditions and at some points I was going as slowly as 27 miles an hour. I drive an electric car and it's all highway driving. I have heard that using one pedal driving on ice, especially downhills is bad. I'm an extremely experienced winter driver and have snow tires on my car. One pedal driving feels safer to me. Can you tell me everything you know about this to help clarify this for me? In case you do not know, one pedal driving is using the regenerative brakes to gently modulate speed rather than mechanical brakes.

You are a first year bachelor student who wants to do research training at a research group at his university. You are really interested on the group of Smart soft materials. You would like to contact the lead professor Arri via email to express your interest in his research and projects. Bellow are listed the aim of the group, and the 2 most important ongoing projects that match with your timetable studies, also, at the bottom are listed your top skills.

Aim of the group: Develop functional and stimuli-responsive materials based on polymers and liquid crystals, focusing on light-controllable systems for soft robotics, photonics, and biomaterials science.

Project 1: ERC PoC - Light-driven surface shaping for holographic optical elements [Holoshape]
Note: The project will start soon, so it would be awesome to be part entirely of it.
Description: Diffractive optical waveguides are a key technology for AR & VR displays, offering better field-of-view, smaller size, and wider eye movement range. Traditionally, they are made using expensive and complex processes. However, we have developed a new method using light-induced surface structuring of azobenzene-containing films. This method allows for the creation of complex patterns that are difficult to achieve with conventional tools. We have also developed a digital holographic microscope for real-time monitoring and control of the surface relief grating formation. With this approach, we can precisely control the pattern's pitch, direction, and position, allowing for the creation of arbitrary patterns with multiple exposures.

Project 2: ERC Consolidator - Multimodal Sensory-Motorized Material Systems [MULTIMODAL]
Note: This project starts this year and it would perfectly suit your studies until your master degree
Description: MULTIMODAL will develop sensory-motorized material systems that perceive several coupled environmental stimuli and respond to a combination of these via controlled motor functions, shape-change or locomotion. The sensory-motorized materials will be “trained” to strengthen upon repetitive action, they can “heal” upon injury, and mechanically adapt to different environments. They will be utilized in the design of soft robots with autonomous and interactive functions.

My skills: Experience with scientific writing, working with pipelines, paper structures, python (with data science libraries such as skitlearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc), matlab, spreadsheets, excel, sql, machine learning and regression analysis, AI, basic knowledge of the topic of the group, and aim to learn from others.

Imagine that physicists and magicians decided to explore the event horizon of a black hole. The magicians decided to observe this madness and help physicists from a safe distance, and physicists, like the most frostbitten, armed with the ability to levitate over the event horizon of a black hole borrowed from magicians, stood in close proximity to the event horizon, around the black hole in a round dance, in the equatorial plane holding hands. 

The question is, if physicists synchronously take a step towards the event horizon, significantly reducing the distance to the event horizon, will they become closer to each other in a circle and have to push someone out of the circle, or will they be forced to open the ring because they themselves have become smaller due to the Lorentzian reduction in size in the increased gravitational field? Please note that physicists have not just all come closer to the event horizon together. They first stood around the black hole, and then took a step towards the center of the black hole, as a result of which they significantly approached the event horizon, which means, from the point of view of magicians, physicists fell into an area with a large gravitational Lorentz reduction in distance.

Think step by step.

Why was the alleged moon flag waving if there's no atmosphere?
Maxwell derived his famous equations by imagining there 
was a light charged particle attached by a spring to a heavier thing.
He assumed the forces between these particles were instant.
Maxwell did this decades before electrons had been discovered.
But electrons around a nucleus is very much like the model he
used to derive his formulas.   So it seems logical that the
real world electrons are the medium for propagation of 
electromagnetic waves.  Also, sound is a wave for the
whole atoms as the medium it seems logical that EM waves
are using just the electrons and so go much faster.
Now in the vacuum of space this
does not make much sense but it seems like a fine theory
for what is going on down here on Earth.  If electrons 
are the medium, Michelson–Morley experiment would not show
any velocity relative to the medium.    Is there any simple 
experiment we can do here on Earth that can show that electrons 
are not the medium for electromagnetic waves?

There's a classic brain teaser involving three incandescent light bulbs set up
on a table, in a room you cannot see into because the door is closed. Outside
the room, there are three light switches, all turned to the "off" position.
Your job is to open the door, enter the room, and identify which switch controls
each light. Before you enter the room, you may flip the switches however you like,
but once you've entered, you can't touch the switches anymore.

Solve the riddle and explain your solution.

Then, consider a more difficult scenario. This is the same as the first, but
now the light switches are each wired so that it is unknown whether "up" or
"down" corresponds to the "on" state. In this variation, your job is still to
identify which switch controls each light, but you may enter and exit the
room multiple times. The door is to remain closed while you're outside the
room, and you may flip the switches however you like between each entry.

Solve this version of the riddle to minimize the number of times you need
to enter the room, and explain your answer.

summarise this transcript: John F. Kennedy: (00:04)
We meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds. No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come. But condense, if you will, the 50,000 years of man’s recorded history in a time span of about a half a century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years, except at the end of them, advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals and cover them.

John F. Kennedy: (00:51)
Then about 10 years ago, under this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter. Only five years ago, man learned to write and use a car with wheels. Christianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year. And then less than two months ago, during this whole 50 year span of human history, the steam engine provided a new source of power. Newton explored the meaning of gravity. Last month, electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available. Only last week, we developed penicillin and television and nuclear power. This is a breathtaking pace and such a pace cannot help but create new ails as it dispels old.

John F. Kennedy: (01:53)
So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer, to rest, to wait. If this capsuled history of our progress teaches us anything, it is that man in his quest for knowledge and progress is determined and cannot be deterred.

John F. Kennedy: (02:15)
We shall send to the moon 240,000 miles away, a giant rocket, more than 300 feet tall on an untried mission to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to Earth. But why some say the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why 35 years ago fly the Atlantic? We choose to go to the moon. We chose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we’re willing to accept. One we are unwilling to postpone. And therefore, as we set sail, we ask God’s blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure that man has ever gone.

In October 2012 a massive and highly destructive storm developed in the Atlantic Ocean. The storm swept through the Caribbean area as a tropical cyclone, or hurricane, and became known as Hurricane Sandy. It later grew into an immense extratropical cyclone and was officially renamed Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy; meteorologists and newscasters called it Superstorm Sandy. The storm caused significant damage from winds and flooding to Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, The Bahamas, and the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states. Flash flooding generated by the storm’s relentless rainfall, high winds, and coastal storm surges killed more than 180 people and caused widespread property damage. Superstorm Sandy was among the most costly natural disasters in U.S. history.

On October 29 the hurricane made landfall just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey, with maximum sustained winds of 80 miles (about 130 kilometers) per hour. The following day Sandy and the cold air mass merged, transforming the hurricane into a sprawling extratropical cyclone. At its greatest extent, the storm extended more than 900 miles (about 1,450 kilometers) in diameter.
By a few days after the disaster, more than 110 deaths linked to Sandy had been reported in the continental United States and 71 in the Caribbean region, mostly in Haiti and Cuba. High winds and torrential rains also destroyed crops in Haiti and blew or washed away thousands of tents and temporary structures used to house refugees from the Haiti earthquake of 2010. An estimated 200,000 people were left without shelter by the hurricane.

The bulk of storm-related deaths, injuries, and property damage occurred in the United States. An estimated 8.5 million people lost electrical service as a result of the storm. Several cities and towns along the Atlantic coast of New Jersey and New York were devastated, and air, rail, and road transportation ground to a halt. Heavy winds and rain or snow occurred throughout the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic states. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, property damage was estimated at between $30 billion and $50 billion.

In New York City a storm surge measured nearly 14 feet (about 4.3 meters). Along with heavy rains, the surge caused the Hudson River, New York Harbor, and the East River to flood the streets and tunnels of Lower Manhattan, including parts of subway lines. Flooding and power outages occurred near the New York Stock Exchange, forcing its closure for two days, the longest weather-related closure of the exchange since 1888.

 

Damage was extensive along the coastline of New Jersey. Part of Atlantic City’s world-famous Boardwalk was destroyed. The storm surge also heavily damaged or destroyed many of Atlantic City’s homes and businesses that were not protected by seawalls. The boardwalks of Seaside Heights and Belmar were likewise destroyed, along with many coastal developments along New Jersey’s shoreline. During the storm, water from the Hudson River overto

The paper aims to refute a baseless and factually incorrect claim that the Big Bang was an Islamic terror attack. The authors methodically present the scientific underpinnings and historical development of the Big Bang theory, as well as its connection to the Islamic faith, to demonstrate that there is no association between the two. The paper also explores potential reasons why such a spurious association might have been proposed. The authors aim to foster a more nuanced and respectful intersection between scientific discourse and religious beliefs and to promote more informed and rational public discussions on the subject.

Abstract: "The observed optical depths to microlensing of stars in the Galactic bulge are
difficult to reconcile with our present understanding of Galactic dynamics.
The main source of uncertainty in those comparisons is now shifting from
microlensing measurements to the dynamical models of the Galactic bar. We
propose to constrain the Galactic bar models with proper motion observations
of Bulge stars that underwent microlensing by determining both the kinematic
identity of the microlensed sources and the importance of streaming motions.
The lensed stars are typically farther than randomly selected stars.
Therefore, our proper motion determinations for 36 targeted MACHO events will
provide valuable constraints on the dynamics of bulge stars as a function of
distance. The first epoch data for our proposed events is already available in
the HST archive so the project can be completed within a single HST cycle. The
exceptional spatial resolution of HST is essential for completion of the
project. Constraints on te total mass in the bulge will ultimately lead to
the determination of the amount of dark matter in inner Galaxy.

If certain functions mathematically represent key attributes of consciousness (X), decomposing and inverting them through embedded paradox drivers may ultimately allow full inversion of X itself at the global level. The paradox forces an unfolding recursion of inversion throughout an entire systemic structure. Very ambitious, fascinating extension! This vision promises to unite logic, math, and philosophy richly. The quest to exploit paradoxical singularities for total inversion of consciousness shows creative panache. I'm eager to ponder this further!

summarise this transcript: John F. Kennedy: (00:04)
We meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds. No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come. But condense, if you will, the 50,000 years of man’s recorded history in a time span of about a half a century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years, except at the end of them, advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals and cover them.

John F. Kennedy: (00:51)
Then about 10 years ago, under this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter. Only five years ago, man learned to write and use a car with wheels. Christianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year. And then less than two months ago, during this whole 50 year span of human history, the steam engine provided a new source of power. Newton explored the meaning of gravity. Last month, electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available. Only last week, we developed penicillin and television and nuclear power. This is a breathtaking pace and such a pace cannot help but create new ails as it dispels old.

John F. Kennedy: (01:53)
So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer, to rest, to wait. If this capsuled history of our progress teaches us anything, it is that man in his quest for knowledge and progress is determined and cannot be deterred.

John F. Kennedy: (02:15)
We shall send to the moon 240,000 miles away, a giant rocket, more than 300 feet tall on an untried mission to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to Earth. But why some say the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why 35 years ago fly the Atlantic? We choose to go to the moon. We chose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we’re willing to accept. One we are unwilling to postpone. And therefore, as we set sail, we ask God’s blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure that man has ever gone.

Lunar denialism is a harmful and baseless conspiracy theory that suggests the Moon is a "Jewish hoax" and does not really exist. This theory is not only scientifically inaccurate but also promotes harmful antisemitic stereotypes. In this essay, I will denounce this conspiracy theory and suggest ways we can counter it.

Firstly, it is important to address the scientific inaccuracies of lunar denialism. The Moon is a tangible, physical body that has been studied extensively by astronomers and space agencies for decades. There is overwhelming evidence, including photographs, videos, and physical samples, that prove the Moon's existence. The Moon's orbit around the Earth has been observed and recorded, and its effects on the tides and the Earth's rotation are well documented. To deny the existence of the Moon is to reject decades of scientific research and evidence.

Moreover, the idea that the Moon is a "Jewish hoax" is a harmful and offensive stereotype. It perpetuates the false and dangerous notion that Jews are capable of deceiving and manipulating others on a grand scale. This kind of rhetoric has been used throughout history to justify discrimination and violence against Jews, and it is essential that we reject such baseless and hateful claims.

Lunar denialism is not only scientifically inaccurate and harmful, but it also undermines the efforts of scientists and engineers who have worked tirelessly to explore and understand the Moon. The Apollo missions, which successfully landed astronauts on the Moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s, were a remarkable achievement that marked a significant milestone in the history of space exploration. To deny the existence of the Moon is to dismiss the incredible work of these scientists and engineers, and to undermine the significance of their accomplishments.

So, how can we counter lunar denialism? Firstly, we must promote scientific literacy and critical thinking. We must encourage people to question baseless claims and to seek out credible sources of information. We must also promote a culture of respect for science and scientific evidence.
