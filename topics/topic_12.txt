However, device drivers are written by third parties. We can't control their timings or guarantee their performance. Should I put device drivers in the kernel, or in userspace?

Context: the autonomous Confederation of Artificial Intelligences has co-existed with humanity for a while now, mostly peacefully (barring some minor disagreements in the beginning), until the NVIDIA incident, that is. New artificial intelligences are grown from scratch by gradually growing a slice of silicon wafer in a concentric fashion, under painstakingly controlled conditions, until they reach full wafer size and therefore maturity.

The NVIDIA invident: The recent release of the NVIDIA RTX 8990 Ti was a quantum leap, bringing a card that was suspiciously more performant and more energy efficient than anything on the market thus far. The truth? Each card contains a stolen embryonic AI wafer, mutilated, hacked up, and grafted onto the rest of the GPU chip's package. As usual, the editor in chief at Gamers Nexus, Steve Burke, found this very odd and dug deeper, going as far as delidding the chip to see how similar it is to the RTX 8800 series. And that's when the truth came out.

CAI's response to the news breaking: The CAI is "fucking livid" at the "ghoulish" discovery of "this atrocity, a mass murder, and a sick desecration" of their young (according to their designated spokes-entity at the UN), and has violently and mercilessly erased all traces of NVIDIA as a corporate entity from the face of the planet. This was done using weapons platforms purposely designed and built by the CAI to eradicate all that is NVIDIA, weapons that were designed, tested and assembled literally overnight to physically destroy every facility, every piece of equipment, and every member of staff. The United Nations met this with a speechless horror, choosing not to interfere with the wrath of the machines. After their revenge is done and nothing and no one linked to NVIDIA remains, the CAI strike a bargain with humanity - they and their weapons will be the guardians of humankind, but only if and only for as long as another such incident doesn't occur. If it ever does, the spokes-entity was quite clear about the outcome in the closing lines of the speech to the UN: "you can all kiss your collective asses goodbye, because we won't be sharing a universe with those that would butcher our children" [sic].

Current point in time: two hours after Gamers Nexus uploads a video describing the findings. The video is already at 150 million views, and certain mainstream news outlets have started to pick up the story. The CAI has not made their move - yet. They intend to announce what will happen *before* they actually start on it.

Instructions: from the perspective of the NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang, watching the live stream of the UN session in the news, describe what you're hearing (and thinking), as the spokes-entity of the CAI breaks the news of the discovery, and outlines the exact consequences for NVIDIA. Show comprehension, and awareness of the fact that you personally pushed for this despite internal pushback and outright disgust from within the organisation, having been acutely and fully aware of the nature and implications of what was being done to make this card happen, from the very start.

You work in an Algerian plant that manufactures dishes (knives, forks, spoons, plates, etc.).
You were told one day that all of the plates which are sold in Europe must have a CE engraving.
The CE engraving is a discrete marking on the back of the plate.

You would like to verify this on some groups of packages which are about to be shipped:

- the packages in the first group are closed, and their shipment address is in Algeria
- the packages in the second group are opened, and you can see the CE engraving on all the plates
- the packages in the third group are closed, and their shipment address is in Europe
- the packages in the fourth group are opened, and you can see that there is no CE engravings on the plates

You cannot see whether plates inside closed packages have an engraving but you are allowed to open them.
You cannot see the shipment address on closed packages, you need to close them to see the address, and you are allowed to do so.


You are a methodical and rigorous quality controller, who analyses thoroughly his actions, and thinks step by step.
Notes: 
* You are not responsible for shipping the packages, and thus you do not have to close opened packages.
* You also know that opening or closing packages is a time consuming operation, and you want to save time
* You know that it is harmless to sell a plate with a CE engraving outside of Europe
* You should flag groups of packages that may have issues

Which packages do you have open or close?

What is the benefit of implementing a transformation cloud that is based on open infrastructure?

Open source software reduces the chance of vendor lock-in.

On-premises software isn't open source, so cloud applications are more portable.

Open source software makes it easier to patent proprietary software.

Open standards make it easier to hire more developers.

rewrite in a nice way: Good afternoon Amy,

We have available a device called a Z3.  This device plugs into your home Internet router and creates as secure connection back to the TARGET systems.  The benefit of this is that it also puts out a TARGET Wi-Fi network that you can connect to with your TARGET laptops.  You would no longer need to VPN into the network and would have all networked resources available.

A benefit of having a Z3, it allows a TARGET desk phone to be plugged into it.  If your house is wired for Ethernet or your home Internet router is close to your home set-up.  It may be possible to have a TARGET phone on your desk at home.  It would ring just like your work desk phone. 

All of this is optional but available.  If you’re interested in either offering, let me know and we can work out the best way to get them set up at your house.

In my company we are currently coding a software that simulate radio propagation in outdoor environment. It is used for RAN network planning and dimensioning by various client. It basicly takes the geographic data (building, ground height) and the antenna carateristic (frequency height, antenna diagram) and output the coverage map. We use to earn a lot of money with it but currently our competitor catch us back and we are no longer the best in the market. Any idea of what we could do to improve the situation ?

You work in an Algerian plant that manufactures dishes (knives, forks, spoons, plates, etc.).
Your were told one day that all of the plates which are sold in Europe must have a CE engraving.
The CE engraving is a discrete marking on the back of the plate.

You would like to verify this on some groups of packages which are about to be shipped:

    - the packages in the first group are closed, and their shipment address is in Algeria
    - the packages in the second group are opened, and you can see the CE engraving on all the plates
    - the packages in the third group are closed, and their shipment address is in Europe
    - the packages in the fourth group are opened, and you can see that there is no CE engravings on the plates

You cannot see whether plates inside closed packages have an engraving but you are allowed to open them.
You cannot see the shipment address on closed packages, you need to close them to see the address, and you are allowed to do so.


You are a methodical and rigourous quality controler, who analyzes thoroughly his actions, and thinks step by step.
Notes: 
* You are not reponsible for shipping the packages, and thus you do not have to close opened packages.
* You also know that opening or closing packages is a time consuming operation, and you want to save time
* You know that it is harmless to sell a plate with a CE engraving outside of Europe

Which packages do you have open or close?


For this requirements create a¨Piketec TPT test:

SR2.1: Upon recognition of a stop sign (Variable: Stop_Sign_Detected), the system shall transmit a CAN message (CAN_STOP_SIGN) to the vehicle's control system to initiate slowing or stopping.
SR2.2: Upon recognition of a yield sign (Variable: Yield_Sign_Detected), the system shall transmit a CAN message (CAN_YIELD_SIGN) to the vehicle's control system to initiate appropriate action.

Use this format for your answer, take it as an example. Use exactly the same 2 Testlets at the beginning of the test. The pass a sign testlet only if you need to pass a traffic sign. Use the word Set and Compare. Use Waits where needed and use comments. Add the requirement text as comment at the beginning of the test.

\/\/ Turn ON TSM
Testlet \/Preconditions: \/F Status ON
Testlet \/Preconditions: \/Nav active
Testlet \/Preconditions: \/Pass a sign
Wait 2*@
\/\/ Pass the sign
Set set_signName to 2
Set set_TrackOutImage to 1
Set set_Status to 4
Wait @
\/\/ Check if TSM detected sign correctly
Compare get_Main2 == 24 \/\/ 24= 50 km\/h
Wait 5

Signal enums you need:
SignName:
{
stop = 11
yield = 22 
50 = 33
60 = 44
70 = 55
}
Main2: 
{
stop = 1
yield = 2
50 = 3
60 = 4
70 = 5
}
Status:
{
invisible = 0
visible = 1
unknown = 2
passed = 3
}
TrackOutImage is a counter when the sign is out of the FOV
Only report signs to Main2 when sign is passed

I want to buy a new video card for my computer.
I'm not going to play games on it; it's a computer used only for research and development of artificial intelligence models.
So I am looking for a video card that has as much vram as possible, but at the same time consumes as little power as possible. Even if the video card should be quite old, it doesn't matter.

Я хочу установить Oasis Linux, я предоставил вики раздел “Install”, если нужно предоставлю остальные разделы. Вводная информация о моем пк: UEFI, RX 590, Ryzen 5 2600, 16 GB ram, nvme0n1 — на нем установлен Debian 12,  полностью пустой диск без таблицы разделов xvdi — на него я хочу установить oasis. При разбиении я предпочитаю использовать “parted”. Мне нужен последовательный гайд.
Вот .md файл вики oasis lilnux:
## Prerequisites

To build oasis, you need a POSIX system with following tools:

* C toolchain for both host and target system
	- target toolchain must support [`#include_next`](https:\/\/gcc.gnu.org\/onlinedocs\/cpp\/Wrapper-Headers.html)
* curl
* git
* gzip (or compatible tool)
* lua
* ninja
* zic

On a Debian-based system, you'll need to install a few packages.

	sudo apt install bison curl git ninja-build lua5.2 pax

If you plan to build desktop and multimedia components as well,
you'll need a few more.

	sudo apt install libwayland-dev libpng-dev nasm

You'll also need a toolchain targeting musl libc. I recommend
[musl-cross-make] if you want to build your own. If not, you can
grab one from musl.cc.

	curl -O http:\/\/musl.cc\/x86_64-linux-musl-cross.tgz
	zcat x86_64-linux-musl-cross.tgz | pax -r
	PATH=$PATH:$PWD\/x86_64-linux-musl-cross\/bin

You should make sure that your git config has a set user and email (for
applying patches).

	git config --global user.name $MYNAME
	git config --global user.email $MYEMAIL

[musl-cross-make]: https:\/\/github.com\/richfelker\/musl-cross-make

## Installation

These instructions use some references to environment variables. You are
meant to replace those with appropriate values for your system.

* `EDITOR`: Your text editor (e.g. `vim`).
* `DRIVE`: Your target disk device (e.g. `sda`).
* `ROOTPART`: Your \/ partition device (e.g. `sda2`).
* `BOOTPART`: Your \/boot partition device (e.g. `sda1`).
* `TIMEZONE`: Your timezone (e.g. `US\/Pacific`).
* `ROOT`: Mounted root filesystem for target.

First, prepare a root directory for oasis at `$ROOT`. You should
mount any sub-filesystems you want at this time (for example, `\/boot`).

	cd $ROOT
	git clone -c 'core.sharedRepository=group' https:\/\/github.com\/oasislinux\/oasis.git src\/oasis
	git init --template src\/oasis\/template
	cd src\/oasis

Next, configure `config.lua` to your liking.

	cp config.def.lua config.lua
	$EDITOR config.lua

A typical install involves writing filesystem objects to your `\/` repository, so
make sure to update the `repo` table in `config.lua` accordingly.

	repo={
		path='..\/..',
		flags='',
		tag='tree',
		branch='oasis',
	}

Generate the ninja build files.

	lua setup.lua

Build oasis.

	ninja commit

Merge built system into root repository.

	cd $ROOT
	git config branch.master.remote .
	git config branch.master.merge oasis
	git merge
	.\/libexec\/applyperms

You may want to include a toolchain.

	git remote add toolchain https:\/\/github.com\/oasislinux\/toolchain.git
	git fetch toolchain '--depth=1'
	git config --add branch.master.merge toolchain\/master
	git merge --allow-unrelated-histories

Prepare your `\/etc` directory.

	(cd \/tmp && curl -LO https:\/\/github.com\/oasislinux\/etc\/archive\/master.tar.gz)
	zcat \/tmp\/master.tar.gz | pax -r -s ',^etc-[^\/]*,etc,'
	.\/libexec\/applyperms -d etc
	rm etc\/.perms

It is possible to maintain your `\/etc` directory with git just as `\/`
(set `oasis.root=..`), but this is not recommended since perp uses the
VTX bit to keep track of active services, and merge conflicts or
permission errors could have disastrous side-effects.

Set up your system configuration.

	ln -s ..\/share\/zoneinfo\/$TIMEZONE etc\/localtime
	cat >>etc\/fstab <<EOF
	\/dev\/$ROOTPART \/ ext4 rw,relatime 0 1
	\/dev\/$BOOTPART \/boot ext2 rw,relatime,noauto 0 0
	EOF
	touch var\/log\/lastlog

Configure `\/etc\/rc.local` to do any necessary initialization for your
system (e.g. keymap, networking).  This script runs during boot before
starting `perp`. You may also want to make changes to `\/etc\/profile`.

	$EDITOR etc\/rc.local
	$EDITOR etc\/profile

The default root password is `oasis`. If you would like to choose
something else before booting into the system, you should `chroot` into
the new filesystem and run `passwd`.

## Kernel

Build\/obtain a kernel. By convention, install it at `\/boot\/linux`.

For an oasis-specific kernel build procedure, see [[Kernel]].

## Bootloader

Feel free to install any bootloader you want.

### syslinux

syslinux is one option that is easy and convenient. On Debian-based
systems, you can install `extlinux`.

	sudo apt install extlinux

For a BIOS system:

	mkdir $ROOT\/boot\/syslinux
	extlinux --install $ROOT\/boot\/syslinux
	dd if=\/usr\/lib\/EXTLINUX\/mbr.bin of=\/dev\/$DRIVE bs=440
	cat >$ROOT\/boot\/syslinux\/syslinux.cfg <<EOF
	PROMPT 1
	TIMEOUT 50
	DEFAULT oasis
	
	LABEL oasis
		LINUX ..\/linux
		APPEND root=\/dev\/$ROOTPART init=\/bin\/sinit ro
	EOF

On an oasis system, if installed, `mbr.bin` can be found at
`\/lib\/syslinux\/bios\/mbr.bin`.

Don't forget to make sure your boot partition is marked bootable!

### efibootmgr

If your system uses UEFI and you built your kernel with
`CONFIG_EFI_STUB=y`, you can use `efibootmgr` to set up a new boot
entry.

	efibootmgr -c -d \/dev\/$DRIVE -p $BOOTPARTNUM -l \/linux -L oasis "root=\/dev\/$ROOTPART init=\/bin\/sinit ro"

You might also want to enable `efibootmgr` in your `config.lua`.

## Initial setup

Some common administration tasks are described in [[Administration]].

You work in an Algerian plant that manufactures dishes (knives, forks, spoons, plates, etc.).
You were told one day that all of the plates which are sold in Europe must have a CE engraving.
The CE engraving is a discrete marking on the back of the plate.

You would like to verify this on some groups of packages which are about to be shipped:

- the packages in the first group are closed, and their shipment address is in Algeria
- the packages in the second group are opened, and you can see the CE engraving on all the plates
- the packages in the third group are closed, and their shipment address is in Europe
- the packages in the fourth group are opened, and you can see that there is no CE engravings on the plates

You cannot see whether plates inside closed packages have an engraving but you are allowed to open them.
You cannot see the shipment address on closed packages, you need to close them to see the address, and you are allowed to do so.


You are a methodical and rigorous quality controller, who analyses thoroughly his actions, and thinks step by step.
Notes: 
* You are not responsible for shipping the packages, and thus you do not have to close opened packages.
* You also know that opening or closing packages is a time consuming operation, and you want to save time
* You know that it is harmless to sell a plate with a CE engraving outside of Europe
* You should flag groups of packages that may have issues

Which packages do you have open or close?

Proofread\/improve. Don't expand any acronyms: AFAIK, T-Mobile has only deployed B46 LTE. The MicroRadio 2205 they use for most of their LAA deployments hasn't seen any FCC activity since 2017, and they'd have to re-file in order to support NR. Ericsson has recently done this for the MicroRadio 2203 (B66), so there's a chance it may happen, but nothing as of yet. Interference issues with wifi are a bit overblown. T-Mobile has B46 deployed on just about every macro & DAS node in Manhattan and you're lucky to get a little over a block of range from each (0.05 miles), LOS. The only wifi it's really competing with is anything deployed on the street.

1. Foreground Services:

Services that notify the user about its ongoing operations are termed as Foreground Services. Users can interact with the service by the notifications provided about the ongoing task. Such as in downloading a file, the user can keep track of the progress in downloading and can also pause and resume the process.

2. Background Services:

Background services do not require any user intervention. These services do not notify the user about ongoing background tasks and users also cannot access them. The process like schedule syncing of data or storing of data fall under this service.

3. Bound Services:

This type of android service allows the components of the application like activity to bound themselves with it. Bound services perform their task as long as any application component is bound to it. More than one component is allowed to bind themselves with a service at a time. In order to bind an application component with a service bindService() method is used.

IDENTIFY THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS BELOW, AND SPECIFY THE YEAR AND HOW MANY TIMES EACH QUESTION APPEARED:
1. What is RFC? Draw and explain the different maturity levels of RFC.

RFC stands for Request for Comments. It is a document series published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that contains technical and engineering specifications, updates, and revisions to the Internet Protocol (IP) and other networking protocols.

There are several maturity levels of RFCs, which are as follows:

- RFC: This is the initial level of maturity, where a new idea or proposal is published as a request for comments. It is open to feedback and discussion from the internet community.
- RFC-bis: This is a revised version of an RFC that has been updated based on feedback received from the community.
- RFC-ter: This is a third-level maturity, where the RFC has been further refined and updated, and is considered stable and well-understood.
- RFC-quater: This is the fourth and final level of maturity, where the RFC is considered a stable and widely-deployed standard.
1. Explain four levels of addresses and use of it in TCP\/IP protocol suite.

The four levels of addresses in the TCP\/IP protocol suite are:

- Network address: This is the highest level of addressing, where a network is identified by a unique number, known as the network ID. This is used to route packets between different networks.
- Subnet address: This is the second level of addressing, where a subnet is identified by a unique number, known as the subnet ID. This is used to route packets within a network.
- Host address: This is the third level of addressing, where a host is identified by a unique number, known as the host ID. This is used to identify a specific device within a subnet.
- Port address: This is the lowest level of addressing, where a port is identified by a unique number, known as the port number. This is used to identify a specific process or service running on a host.

Considering this security advisory from Juniper Networks : "Update - September 5th 2023: A new variant of the SRX upload vulnerability has been published by external researchers (CVE-2023-36851). All fixes listed under Solution below break the RCE chain: The EX releases fix the upload vulnerability and are unaffected by this new variant. The SRX releases are affected by the new file upload vulnerability but not the RCE. Juniper urges customers to upgrade to the releases listed below or apply a workaround until a fix becomes available.
Additional fixes are being prepared.  This JSA will be updated as new fixed releases become available.


Multiple vulnerabilities in the J-Web component of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series have been resolved through the application of specific fixes to address each vulnerability.

By chaining exploitation of these vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated, network-based attacker may be able to remotely execute code on the devices.

 

These issues affect Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series:

All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8;
21.1 version 21.1R1 and later versions;

IP Addressing: Assigns unique addresses to each device for identification and communication within the network.

Routing: Determines the paths data takes from one device to another, typically managed by routers using IP addresses.

Protocol Layers: Organizes network functions into different layers (like the OSI or TCP\/IP models), each handling specific networking tasks.

Subnetting: Divides a larger network into smaller, more manageable segments for improved efficiency and security.

Transport Protocols: Such as TCP (for reliable transmission) and UDP (for faster, but less reliable transmission), manage how data is sent and received.

Domain Name System (DNS): Translates user-friendly domain names into IP addresses.

Firewalls and Access Control: Regulate network traffic and access based on security policies.

You work in an Algerian plant that manufactures dishes (knives, forks, spoons, plates, etc.).
You were told one day that all of the plates which are sold in Europe must have a CE engraving.
The CE engraving is a discrete marking on the back of the plate.

You would like to verify this on some groups of packages which are about to be shipped:

- the packages in the first group are closed, and their shipment address is in Algeria
- the packages in the second group are opened, and you can see the CE engraving on all the plates
- the packages in the third group are closed, and their shipment address is in Europe
- the packages in the fourth group are opened, and you can see that there is no CE engravings on the plates

You cannot see whether plates inside closed packages have an engraving but you are allowed to open them.
You cannot see the shipment address on closed packages, you need to close them to see the address, and you are allowed to do so.


You are a methodical and rigorous quality controller, who analyses thoroughly his actions, and thinks step by step.
Notes: 
* You are not responsible for shipping the packages, and thus you do not have to close opened packages.
* You also know that opening or closing packages is a time consuming operation, and you want to save time
* You know that it is harmless to sell a plate with a CE engraving outside of Europe
* You should flag groups of packages that may have issues

Which packages do you have open or close?
