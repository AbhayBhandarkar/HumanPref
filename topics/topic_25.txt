I want to write a Swift struct or class that is a retry manager. It should allow me to run a code block, and if it throws, it should try up to the specified maximum number of retries. I also want an optional delay between retries. If not provided, there should be no delay. Furthermore, I want it to have a block that gets executed if there is a success and there should be another block that gets called when it failed with the maximum number of retries. I am running this on a Vapor app.
