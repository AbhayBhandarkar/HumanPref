Please rewrite the following paragraph within 250 word:     The management of plant viruses is critical for sustainable agriculture, given their substantial economic impact and threat to crop health. New viral diseases continually emerge due to factors like global trade, climate shifts, and the viruses' ability to rapidly evolve. Controlling these diseases revolves around two primary strategies: immunization through genetic resistance and prophylaxis to curtail virus spread using quarantine, removal of infected plants, and vector control. Accurate identification of the culprit virus is fundamental for effective disease management. Diagnosis involves categorizing a virus infecting a plant sample into a group with shared characteristics, ranging from species to strain or variant levels. Precision in diagnosis, achieved by maximizing sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate), hinges on understanding genetic relationships within and across virus groups. While the influence of genetic diversity on virus populations in disease management is well-documented, integrating this diversity into detection methods remains limited. This review delves into techniques for plant virus diagnosis and control, exploring aspects like accuracy, detection level, multiplexing, quantification, portability, and designability. It also addresses how genetic diversity and virus evolution impact the performance of detection and disease control methods. Cutting-edge approaches, such as high-throughput sequencing, offer comprehensive virus identification, enabling multiplex detection, quantification, and even the discovery of new viruses. As costs decrease, this technique is poised to become the standard in diagnostics. Viral diseases pose a significant threat to agriculture, and preventing their entry into plants or developing plant resistance is crucial. Tailored strategies for each virus-host-environment combination are necessary, underscoring the importance of precise diagnostic tools. This review aims to guide plant pathologists in designing and implementing more accurate detection procedures for more effective viral disease management, considering genetic diversity and evolution in virus populations.

In conclusion, the primary challenge facing agriculture in the 21st century is to sustainably produce nutritious food for the growing global population while protecting the environment and human health. Pests and diseases, particularly emerging viral diseases, have significant negative economic impacts on agriculture, making the accurate identification of viruses crucial for disease management. Currently, the first approach when a new virus-like disease appears is to test for known viruses using established techniques such as ELISA. However, antibody production is expensive and unpredictable, making molecular techniques like PCR more suitable for dealing with the frequent emergence of new viruses. Real-time qPCR is becoming the preferred molecular method for routine virus analysis and quantification, while on-site detection techniques like LFA and isothermal amplification provide almost immediate responses.
When these methods fail to detect the causative virus, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is the best approach, as it can identify all viruses in a plant. However, HTS is still too expensive for most routine analyses, necessitating the development of rapid, accurate detection techniques for each virus, with PCR being the easiest to develop. Quarantine and certification require sensitive, broad-spectrum detection methods to minimize escapes, making HTS the best procedure for these purposes.
Prophylactic measures to prevent or minimize virus dispersal require information on virus biology, incidence, and epidemiology, which can be obtained through high-throughput screening techniques like ELISA and molecular hybridization. The other essential aspect of plant disease control is the development of resistant cultivars, mainly through plant breeding. However, resistance is not available for most crops and viruses, and genetic engineering faces opposition in some countries due to concerns about the ecological impact of transgenic plants.
Emerging research fields like CRISPR genome editing and RNA silencing offer promising avenues for future disease management strategies. To achieve more durable and effective protection, it is crucial to characterize the genetic variability and relationships of plant viruses and understand the factors and mechanisms involved in genetic change. HTS has shown great potential for its broad-spectrum detection, sensitivity, and precise quantification, and it is expected that portable nanopore sequencing devices will become the standard diagnostic procedure as costs decrease and analytical procedures improve.

Please read the following abstract from a scientific paper and return the following items in nested JSON format:

2) For each reported outbreak provide the details about the outbreak including the name of the disease, whether it affected animals humans or both, a list of the types of any animals affected, the year the outbreak occurred, the country the outbreak occurred in.
3) Indicate as true \/ false whether there is evidence in the abstract of additional outbreaks occurring but for which details cannot be extracted from the abstract alone.

Here is the abstract, "Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, prion disease of cervids that was first detected in Alberta in 2005. Transmission of CWD by direct contact with infected individuals plays a major role in the early phases of an outbreak. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) comprise 85% of CWD-infected animals in the province, and we investigated the seasonal effects of grouping patterns and landscape heterogeneity on direct, pair-wise contacts (distance of 3 m) within and between sex-specific (same or mixed sex) groups of mule deer in east-central Alberta. We determined seasonal contacts of mule deer based on proximity loggers that alter GPS schedules to record contact locations. We modeled the relative risk of contact between sex-specific dyads both within and between social groups based on landscape characteristics at the location of contact. We then assessed the support for 5 hypotheses that linked locations of seasonal contacts to occurrence of CWD on the landscape. Disease occurrence on the landscape was derived by comparing locations of CWD-infected and CWD-uninfected deer collected as part of the Alberta’s CWD hunter-harvest surveillance program. We found that contacts in winter occurred in areas where deer use was concentrated, whereas in summer, contact locations were less constrained in space where patterns of landscape characteristics at contact locations varied between sex-specific dyads. Contact probabilities of within and between-group male dyads in winter and between-group female dyads in summer were the best predictors of CWD risk in east-central Alberta. Our results relate habitat specific, social behaviors between conspecific mule deer to potential routes of CWD transmission and contribute to CWD research that guides management strategies for an emergent wildlife disease."

Please correct the following text: In contrast to other, mostly non-legume species, the antioxidant quercetin accumulation in soybean was not induced either by UV-B irradiation or copper treatment. On the other hand, the strong increase in isoflavone content suggests that these compounds are related to the plant response to both UV-B irradiation and copper toxicity. The results of the work suggestEve that in soy, the production of isoflavonoids can be an alternative to the production of flavonols under conditions of abiotic stress. Moreover, the different degree of glycosylation of isoflavonoids may indicate their different function. While in the case of UV-B irradiation it may primarily be their antioxidant activity, in the case of heavy metal exposure their chelation activity may be at least equally important.

Explain this view in a line or two :
"Finally, the skeptical view is that even if the genome is edited as expected and the desired functional output is achieved at the given time, the complex relationship between genetic information and biological phenotypes is not fully understood. Therefore, the biological consequence of editing a gene in germline and\/or somatic cells may be unclear and unpredictable depending on the context. Many biological traits are determined by the complex regulatory actions of numerous genes. Hence, is it difficult, if not impossible, to "design" a biological phenotype at the wholeorganism level. Across biological outcomes, whether in normal or in disease development, it is uncommon that a single gene is the only factor shaping a complex biological trait. Other genetic regulatory factors such as additional genes or distal regulatory elements (e.g., enhancer or repressor elements), as well as environmental and epigenetic factors, contribute to the emergence of a biological phenotype. To argue that modifying a gene changes a desired phenotype (under certain conditions) implies at least a reasonable understanding of other independent variables contributing to the phenotype's instantiation. But this understanding is still far from complete in many normal and disease processes [44, 45] . Given the uncertainty regarding how gene expression and modification influence complex biological outcomes, it is difficult to appraise potential risk and benefit. This ambiguity creates a challenge on its own and is one of the sources obscuring efficient ethical deliberation and decision making."

my research question is this so tell me about relevant information from this source:What role did medical innovations and public health responses play in shaping the impact of the 1918-1920 Influenza epidemic on different demographics in the United States?



this is the article: The American military experience in World War I and the influenza pandemic were closely intertwined. The war fostered influenza in the crowded conditions of military camps in the United States and in the trenches of the Western Front in Europe. The virus traveled with military personnel from camp to camp and across the Atlantic, and at the height of the American military involvement in the war, September through November 1918, influenza and pneumonia sickened 20% to 40% of U.S. Army and Navy personnel. These high morbidity rates interfered with induction and training schedules in the United States and rendered hundreds of thousands of military personnel non-effective. During the American Expeditionary Forces' campaign at Meuse-Argonne, the epidemic diverted urgently needed resources from combat support to transporting and caring for the sick and the dead. Influenza and pneumonia killed more American soldiers and sailors during the war than did enemy weapons.

In the fall of 1918, U.S. Army and Navy medical officers in camps across the country presided over the worst epidemic in American history, but the story was not new. War and disease have been linked throughout history as armies, weapons, and human pathogens have met on the battlefield. The conquistadores brought with them diseases that devastated the New World; typhus plagued Napoleon's armies; and typhoid fever humiliated the American Army during the Spanish-American War. But now U.S. Army and Navy personnel knew how to test and sanitize water supplies, vaccinate troops against typhoid and smallpox, and treat or prevent other infections. Modern bacteriology, it seemed, had tamed many diseases. Navy Surgeon General William C. Braisted proudly stated that “infectious diseases that formerly carried off their thousands, such as yellow fever, typhus, cholera, and typhoid, have all yielded to our modern knowledge of their causes and our consequent logical measures taken for their prevention.”1

Twentieth-century warfare, however, had evolved to an even more deadly scale as industrialized armies of millions battled on the plains of Eastern Europe, the cliffs of Gallipoli, and in the deadly trenches of the 550-mile-long Western Front. When the European arms race exploded into war in 1914, the empires shocked themselves and the world with the killing power of their artillery and machine guns, their U-boats and mines, and their poison gas. These new weapons generated new, horrible injuries that took life and limb in a flash or festered into gangrenous wounds that could further maim and kill. The carnage traumatized some men into shellshock, and poison gases burned and suffocated others so horribly that nurses dreaded caring for them because they could provide little comfort. War diseases—notably the soldiers' nemeses diarrhea, dysentery, and typhus—flourished, and the trenches offered new maladies such as “trench foot,” an infection caused by wearing sodden boots and standing in water and mud for days on end, and “trench fever,” a debilitating fever transmitted by body lice.

Then, in the fourth dreadful year of the war, as the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) assumed fighting strength and prepared their first great offensive against the Germans, the flu struck. By the War Department's most conservative count, influenza sickened 26% of the Army—more than one million men—and killed almost 30,000 before they even got to France.2,3 On both sides of the Atlantic, the Army lost a staggering 8,743,102 days to influenza among enlisted men in 1918.4 (p. 1448) The Navy recorded 5,027 deaths and more than 106,000 hospital admissions for influenza and pneumonia out of 600,000 men, but given the large number of mild cases that were never recorded, Braisted put the sickness rate closer to 40%.5,6 (p. 2458)

The Army and Navy medical services may have tamed typhoid and typhus, but more American soldiers, sailors, and Marines would succumb to influenza and pneumonia than would die on the industrialized battlefields of the Great War. The story of the influenza epidemic in the military is often lost in the historical narrative of the Great War, included merely as a coda to that four-year horror, coinciding with the final battles and the Armistice. But an examination of medical reports and War Department and Department of the Navy documents from the war reveals that the war and the epidemic were intertwined.7 World War I and influenza collaborated: the war fostered disease by creating conditions in the trenches of France that some epidemiologists believe enabled the influenza virus to evolve into a killer of global proportions. In turn, disease shaped the war effort by rendering much of the Army and Navy non-effective and diverting resources, personnel, and scarce human attention and energy from the military campaign. The exigencies of war also thwarted many of the efforts such as crowd mitigation and quarantines to control the epidemic. The influenza epidemic in the U.S. military therefore provides a cautionary tale about the power of war to change the health environment and the power of disease to influence the conduct of war.

GOING TO WAR
The United States at first hung back from the killing in Europe, as many Americans believed it was not their fight. But under increasing pressure from Britain and France, and angered by German U-boat attacks that threatened American commerce and security, and the revelations in the Zimmermann Telegram that Germany was urging Mexico to attack the United States, President Wilson abandoned neutrality and in April 1917 asked Congress for a declaration of war.

The U.S. economy was already booming as farmers and manufacturers shipped foodstuffs and military supplies to the belligerent nations. Now the United States would also generate its own military force that would help overwhelm the enemy and bring about the armistice of November 11, 1918. Congress quickly established a draft, and more than 4,600 Selective Service draft boards screened 10 million men to find the strongest and most fit soldiers and sailors. The military grew from just 378,000 strong in April 1917 to more than 4.7 million by war's end, with an Army of 4.1 million and a Navy of 600,000. Seventy-two percent of enlisted forces were inducted, and the military population reflected the country's ethnically diverse and racially segregated society. An estimated 20% of Army draftees were foreign-born and the troops spoke at least 46 languages, some 5,700 were Mexican aliens, and 12,500 were American Indians.8 (p. 367-409) More than 400,000 African Americans served in the Army, some in two black combat divisions but most in labor battalions. The Navy employed only 5,300 black sailors, confining them to positions as cooks and stewards.9

War mobilization drew millions of civilians into military institutions and extended the military into all corners of the country. To train and supply these men, the Army and Navy expanded existing facilities and directed training activities at various civilian organizations. Military camps, arsenals, air fields, and supply depots sprouted up in every state. The Army began training recruits in the fall of 1917 at 32 large camps, each home to 25,000 to 55,000 troops. Soldiers also went to specialized camps for training in specific fields such as artillery training at Camp Knox, Kentucky, railway operations at Camp Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis, military engineering at Camp Forrest, Georgia, and medical unit training at Camp Crane, Pennsylvania. The War Department also operated some 40 air fields for aviator training and 10 embarkation and debarkation camps.8 (p. 677-–78) The Navy expanded its training capacity from 6,000 recruits to more than 100,000 at stations on both coasts, the Gulf of Mexico, and Lake Michigan, and also had specialized training centers such as the Navy gas engine school and the aviation ignition school at Columbia University in New York. In addition to the training camps, in the summer of 1918 the War Department established the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), intended to augment the work of the Reserve Officers Training Corp (ROTC) and prevent war mobilization from emptying institutions of higher education. Under the program, more than 500 colleges and universities trained officer candidates and provided technical instruction in fields such as auto mechanics and radio operation. By the Armistice, about 158,000 young men had enrolled in SATC programs.8 (p. 556) This expansion of military institutions created a virtual network of young adults across which influenza could and would travel (Figure 1).

As the Army grew, the Army Medical Department raced to meet its needs. Military medicine was more like public health medicine (which managed large populations) than private medicine (which focused on care for individuals). By necessity, line officers cared less about who was sick or on leave than who they could send into battle. This was called the “effective” rate—how many men were available in a given unit to work and fight. Medical officers therefore tried to keep non-effective rates as low as possible, and measured their success statistically more than by individual patient care. The Army Medical Department tracked sickness in camps, combat units, labor battalions, ports, and ships by the day, week, month, and year, and compared its record with civilians, earlier wars, and other armies. Army Medicine also combined the old sanitation model of clean water and fresh air with the new public health approaches of educating soldiers on how to stay healthy and prevent disease. Army Surgeon General William C. Gorgas came out of the sanitary tradition and stressed good food, clean water, fresh air, and no crowding, but like other Progressives, also saw the Army as an opportunity to instill young men with middle-class values such as good personal hygiene.10

To care for the growing Army, the Medical Department increased its hospital capacity from 9,500 beds to 120,000 in the United States alone. The Red Cross assisted by recruiting trained nurses for the Army Nurse Corps and organizing ambulance companies and 50 hospitals of 1,000 beds each out of American universities and medical institutions. The Army Medical Department ultimately numbered 30,500 medical officers, 21,500 nurses—including 350 African American physicians but no black nurses until December 1918—and 264,000 enlisted men.8 (p. 257) The Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery had some 3,000 medical officers, 1,700 nurses, and 11,000 enlisted men.5 (p. 2066, 2073) As one civilian public health official pointed out, with almost 30% of American physicians in military service, “…there were sections of the country that were absolutely stripped of physicians.” During the pandemic in civil society, therefore, “…the great majority of available, medical and nursing personnel, were already in the Army or Navy, so that the available personnel from which to draw was limited.”11

Correct the following text: Isoflavones are the main class of isoflavonoids found predominantly in soy. The main and most studied compounds are daidzein, genistein, glycitein and their glycosides, malonylglycosides and acetylglycosides.  Biochanin A and formononetin have also been described there (Karki et al. 2020). Flavonols, are important and widespread class of flavonoids. They are highly abundant in soy mainly as diverse glycosides of quercetin, kaempferol, or, in lesser extent also isorhamnetin. Their presence can vary widely in both quality and quantity among different cultivars (Lee et al. 2022).

i guess interesting part of the covid pandemic is that not once we heard from authorities that we could use zink . Yet in 2010, it was already known that it helps. i am refering to paper named "Zn(2+) inhibits coronavirus and arterivirus RNA polymerase activity in vitro and zinc ionophores block the replication of these viruses in cell culture". Raplph Baric was one of authors. yet few years later he pushed the vaccine as the only remedy, ignoring his own research. That sounds like crime to me.

i think that emergency use auhorisation would not be possible if they did admit it can be treated by vitamins, zink and ivermectin\/hcq.

i guess fauci and baric knew well that zink could save many lives but they needed to push the vaccine. they also did help developing the virus. Which makes them war criminals in my view.

1.	Intended use

RIDASCREEN® Aflatoxin Total is a competitive enzyme immunoassay for the quantitative analysis of aflatoxins in cereals and feed.

2.	General

Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites of the fungi species Aspergillus flavus, parasiticus und nomius. These fungi occur in humid tropical areas and the contamination of vegetable food takes place in the cultivable countries. Aflatoxins belong to the strongest natural occurring cancerogenic substances.
Aflatoxin B1 which is mostly found together with the aflatoxins B2, G1 and G2 is the one with the highest toxic importance. It is found above all in corn, peanuts, brazil nuts, cotton seed and pistachios.
Depending on the toxicity of these mycotoxins in the countries of the EU equal limits are valid for aflatoxins, 2 ppb for aflatoxin B1 and 4 ppb for all aflatoxins in total in cereals.

3.	Test principle

The basis of the test is the antigen-antibody reaction. The wells in the microtiter strips are coated with capture antibodies directed against anti-aflatoxin antibodies. Standards or the sample solutions, aflatoxin-enzyme conjugate and anti-aflatoxin antibodies are added. Free and enzyme conjugated aflatoxin compete for the aflatoxin antibody binding sites (competitive enzyme immunoassay). At the same time, the anti-aflatoxin antibodies are also bound by the immobilized capture antibodies. Any unbound enzyme conjugate is then removed in a washing step. Substrate\/chromogen solution is added to the wells and incubated. Bound enzyme conjugate converts the chromogen into a blue product. The addition of the stop solution leads to a color change from blue to yellow. The measurement is made photometrically at 450 nm; the absorption is inversely proportional to the aflatoxin concentration in the sample.

Your task is to extract biomedical entities from provided text:
Cholesterol synthesis requires cytosolic enzymes, SER, and peroxisomes. It starts from acetyl-CoA and takes place in the following successive steps (see Figure 1): (1) mevalonate is converted in two steps to 5-pyrophosphomevalonate (mevalonate 5-pyrophosphate) using ATP; (2) the five-carbon isoprene unit isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is formed by the decarboxylation of 5-pyrophosphomevalonate (a process requiring ATP); (3) IPP is isomerized to 3,3-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DPP); (4) IPP and DPP condense and form 10-carbon geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP); (5) GPP can re-condense with an IPP molecule to create 15-carbon farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP); (6) two FPPs combine to release pyrophosphate and are reduced forming squalene (a 30-carbon isoprenoid); and (7) squalene is then converted to lanosterol in two successive reactions catalyzed by the SER related enzyme using NADPH and oxygen. Linear squalene hydroxylation cyclizes this structure to lanosterol; followed by (8) conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol through many reactions of chain shortening, oxidative cleavage of methyl groups, reduction of double bonds, and repositioning these bonds.

Given the following two reviews separated by ###:

Review 1:
The findings concerning the role of TIM1 and domains thereof in the trafficking of T cells are original and important. 
The manuscript is clear and uses powerful tools. I do have minor reservations on the discussion concerning apparent differences between findings in this paper and those reported elsewhere. The authors use a simple reductionist tool kit. Normal T cells are not studied (for reasons that are well justified). Differences in the cell population used in this and the cited works may or may not prove important. Next is the choice reagents to conduct the analysis. In mouse systems there are anti Tim1 antibodies that stimulate and others that inhibit T cell activation. It would be fascinating to learn (not in this paper) whether this is due to effects on Tim1 localization in or opposed to the IS.

###

Review 2:
The research described in this article is interesting, mostly well done, and worth publishing. 
My major concerns:1. The manuscript over interprets some of the data.2. The polarized distribution of Tim1 needs a confirmation using primary T cells.3. The effects of Tim1 mutations on the distribution of signaling molecules should be included to support tyrosine phosphorylation data.

- Although it is less than a decade old, CRISPR-Cas9 has demonstrated unprecedented potential to revolutionize innovation in basic science. From viruses and bacteria [50, 51] , to simple model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) [52] , Anopheles gambiae (mosquito) [53] , Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) [54] , Hydra magnipapillata (hydra) [55] , Caenorhabditis elegans (round worm) [56] , Danio rerio (zebra fish) [57] , and Arabidopsis thaliana (rockcress) [58] , to larger animals such as pigs [59] , cattle [60] , and monkeys [61] , and even human zygotes [62, 63] , CRISPR experimentation has led to novel, important findings. Such benefits include at least the following: increased overall efficiency in gene editing compared with previous genomic engineering techniques like transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and zinc finger nucleases (ZNFs) [64] ; significant insights into the evolutionary transformation of fish fins into tetrapod limbs [65] ; investigation into new organisms [66] ; genetic and epigenetic screens [67, 68] ; the creation of novel cell lines [69] ; high-throughput screens and libraries [70] ; the elucidation of novel genomic and epigenomic regulatory pathways [71, 72] ; insights into the development of butterfly coloring and patterning [73] ; the functional characterization of key genes and molecular signaling pathways [74, 75] ; and drug-targeting screens [76, 77] . Data from such experimentation provide essential clues and understanding that promote biomedical discovery, advancement, and the basis for potential medical benefits. One of the major controversies about CRISPR technology emerges from its possible application in human embryos. This controversy is not about CRISPR itself, but instead is largely due to the lack of clarity about the status of the human embryo. Although some in the scientific community maintain that it is ethically impermissible to experiment on human embryos after 14 days [78, 79] , it is impossible for any one party-whether it is a government, laboratory, funding agency, panel of experts, court, religious organization, or other group-to decide the status of a human embryo [80, 81] and whether and precisely when it has "personhood" [82] : Is the entity merely a ball of cells whose status is like that of human skin, which sheds regularly without further ado? Or does the entity hold complete personhood status-with irreducible, inalienable moral rights and to whom we owe important directed duties? Or is the embryo's status characterized optimally as something in between? And if so, which moral rights might this entity hold, and which duties might we owe to it? Despite this perplexing complexity, decisions one way or the other must be executed, because proceeding with research or failing to do so has important consequences: Banning or significantly limiting research on human embryos stymies progress at least by making unavailable or curtailing an option to

As cases of measles increase globally and spread throughout the world, the risk locally will increase, experts said. TNS\n\nBecause there are fewer Tarrant County children who have received the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine in the last year, the county is at an increased risk of a measles outbreak like the one spreading in Columbus, Ohio, epidemiology experts said.\n\n“Measles is sort of the canary in the coal mine,” said Dr. William Moss, the director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “It’s probably the most contagious of vaccine preventable diseases.”\n\nThe outbreak in Ohio has infected 85 people, according to data from the Columbus Department of Public Health. Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated children, and at least 36 people have been hospitalized.\n\nEpidemiology experts said the combination of decreased measles vaccination rates throughout the world and in the United States, including in Fort Worth, and the ability of the virus to spread easily puts North Texas at an increased risk of an outbreak.\n\n“There are many communities just like Columbus, throughout the United States, including perhaps Fort Worth, where there are large enough numbers of susceptible individuals, whether they’re children or adults, to fuel a measles outbreak,” Moss said.\n\nThose susceptible individuals are people who haven’t been fully vaccinated with at least two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. As cases of the virus increase globally, the risk locally will increase, he said.\n\nHow measles outbreaks start\n\nMeasles was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, thanks to the wide availability and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine.\n\nBecause measles is not spreading within communities or throughout the U.S., virtually every known measles outbreak in recent history has happened when someone traveled abroad and brought the virus back to the U.S., where the traveler has transmitted the virus to susceptible, unvaccinated communities. Outbreaks typically occur when a cluster of unvaccinated people live, work, or play in the same community, and then a traveler introduces the virus

Please correct and improve the following scientific text. Abbrevations: LN - low nitrogen conditions (low nirogen cause stress and deficiency symptoms in plants) , MN - medium nitrogen (nitrogen is limited but without deficiency symptoms). Text: Among the 12 PAL isogenes tested in L. corniculatus leaves, four of them (LcPAL4, LcPAL8, LcPAL9 and LcPAL10) were significantly induced under LN conditions (Figure 2). However, on MN no clear increase of PAL expression was determined, so the increase in PAL activity in such condition was not regulated at the transcription level, rather a post-translational regulation can be suggested. Increase of PAL activity on MN was not accompanied with increased in flavonoid compounds, rather with increased accumulation of phenylpropanoids that also might be related to the changes in biosynthesis of lignin and\/or other related compounds. Impact of N-status on lignin production has been reported in different species (Rivai et al. 2021, Zhang et al. 2017). However, this point has not been investigated in detail in the present work and need further investigation to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, although supports the view, that the general response of plants to LN and MN conditions was different.

Summarize this statement:
In this work, we evaluated the information content of shallow shotgun sequencing
as a potential alternative to 16S sequencing in certain situations. We found that
surprisingly few shotgun metagenomic sequences are needed to obtain more reliable
species and gene group profiles than 16S sequencing at approximately the same cost
as 16S sequencing. We also compared shallow shotgun sequencing to deep shotgun
sequencing of a number of biological data sets, including samples from the HMP, a
published deep shotgun diabetes study, and simulated and mock communities, and
found that we could recover similar trends in alpha and beta diversity, species profiles,
and species biomarker discovery down to a 0.05% relative abundance with as few as 0.5
million sequences per sample. We then analyzed two human stool samples with new
ultradeep shotgun sequencing data at 2.5 billion reads per sample, the deepest
sequencing coverage yet obtained of any microbiome to our knowledge. We found
that shallow sequencing recovers 97% to 99% of the correlated species and KEGG (16)
Orthology group (KO) profiles found by ultradeep sequencing. Although we obtained
shallow shotgun sequencing on the data described in this paper by subsampling
originally deep shotgun sequencing data, we expect subsampling to provide an
unbiased representation of the data that would be observed in actual shallow shotgun
sequencing. We also found, using HMP samples with paired 16S sequencing and
shotgun data, that shallow shotgun sequencing is superior to 16S sequencing for
recovery and annotation of species.
We did not attempt to perform an exhaustive comparison of different sequence
annotation tools, as that was outside the scope of our investigation. Instead, we
selected several tools representing different approaches to database search for comparison, including exhaustive semiglobal gapped alignment (18, 19), heuristic gapped
alignment using the Burrows-Wheeler transformation (23), and k-mer-based searching
(21, 25). Using simulated metagenomic data, we found that tools using gapped
alignment obtained higher precision and recall than tools using k-mer-based mapping.
This result was expected, as k-mer mapping requires exact matches of fixed-size k-mers,
whereas gapped alignment allows insertion of gaps at random to maximize overall
sequence identity. In our simulated data, fully exhaustive end-to-end gapped alignment with a minimum threshold of 95% identity using an accelerated version of
Needleman-Wunsch alignment (18, 19) performed best in terms of recall. Several
methods were approximately tied for highest precision. A potential advantage of
gapped alignment over k-mer mapping is that current alignment-based tools report
the genomic coordinates of each match, allowing estimation of strain-level coverage,
which may be useful for future work into novel algorithms that use strain-level
coverage to further improve precision and recall for rare species.

Summarize this: An important variant of the annotation problem lies within the context of an ab initio labeling of a single dataset where only a subset of the cells can be confidently annotated based on the raw data. This increasingly prevalent scenario may result from limited sensitivity of the scRNA-seq assay, where marker genes may only be confidently observed in a small subset of cells. One common way to address this problem is to compute some form of a distance metric between cells (e.g., after embedding with scVI or using Seurat PCA)

Please rewrite the following paragraph within 250 word:       Resistance genes are limited for many crops and viruses. Alternatives are evolving known genes’ specificities and using genome editing to introduce resistance or impair host factors. However, mutations may have adverse effects. Resistance can fail due to: mixed infections; positive selection of viral mutations overcoming resistance; recombination\/reassortment producing resistance-breaking genotypes. Targeting essential viral functions under negative selection makes resistance breakdown unlikely to spread. Polygenic resistance is more durable. Predicting new resistance durability is difficult. Understanding factors enabling breakdown mutations to emerge and spread is progressing but field testing over years is needed. Rapid, precise diagnostics help monitor resistance effectiveness and breakdown. Prophylaxis limits spread. Sanitation eliminates infected material. Certification programs test material. Thermotherapy and shoot-tip grafting remove viruses. Cross-protection uses mild strains to preclude severe strains. Vector control limits transmission. Combined strategies consider viral evolution, deploying multilayered barriers to dispersion. Breeders consider host variability but often neglect viral variability, risking resistance breakdown. Another strategy for obtaining resistant plants harnesses RNA silencing, a regulatory mechanism controlling gene expression in eukaryotes and an antiviral defense. The host RNA silencing machinery targets viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates or secondary structures in genomic RNA, detected by Dicer-like proteins that cleave them into 21-24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs). One strand integrates into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), guiding sequence-specific cleavage of viral RNAs. Cleaved RNAs are amplified by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), enhancing the defense and inhibiting infection.
Many viruses encode RNA silencing suppressors (RSSs) that counter this defense by binding siRNAs or host factors. Some viruses synergistically interact, with RSSs increasing titer or symptoms. Resistance uses transgenes producing viral dsRNAs or structured ssRNAs to trigger RNA silencing. As RNA silencing requires nucleotide identity between the virus and transgene, viral population variability must be considered. Real-time qPCR best evaluates RNA silencing-based resistance. Silencing resistance can break down through mutation\/selection or mixed infection. Transgenes from multiple viral genomes (same\/different species) minimize breakdown risk. Transgenes mimicking endogenous miRNA precursors express artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) targeting viral RNAs. amiRNAs are more conserved and broadly target genera\/families but can still breakdown. Multiple amiRNAs against one virus or syn-tasiRNAs (synthetic trans-acting siRNAs) targeting multiple sites\/viruses may increase durability. Experimental evolution (passaging virus through resistant plants) evaluates durability. qPCR detects titer increases indicating breakdown. PCR\/Sanger or HTS sequencing identifies fixed mutations. Infectious clones test each mutation's effect. Exogenous dsRNAs immunize plants. Efficacy improves with high-pressure spraying, cell-penetrating peptides, or clay nanoparticles stabilizing dsRNAs. Overall, RNA silencing-based resistance and exogenous dsRNAs show promise but require considering viral population variability and evolution to achieve durability. Rapid, precise diagnostics are critical to monitor resistance effectiveness and breakdown, enabling proactive management.
Another immunization method is cross-protection based on inoculating mild or attenuated viral strains to protect plants against severe strains of the same virus. Cross-protection has been applied to several viruses and crops, such as PepMV in tomato and CTV in citrus crops (Pechinger et al., 2019). The mechanism of cross-protection is poorly understood and several models have been proposed: prevention of virus entry into cells; competition for host factors for replication, interference with disassembly, translation or replication; and induction of RNA silencing leading to sequence-specific degradation of the superinfecting virus (Ziebell and Carr, 2010; Folimonova, 2013). It has been suggested that cross- protection in some viruses might be an active virus-controlled function involving virus-coded proteins (Folimonova, 2013). A recent model proposed that cross-protection is a mechanism that prevents the virus progeny to replicate in the cells to minimize mutation rate and collaterally targets highly homologous superinfecting viruses that are indistinguishable from progeny viruses (Zhang X. et al., 2018). To apply cross-protection it is necessary to evaluate the genetic and biological variability of the local virus population and search for mild isolates genetically close to the severe ones (Hanssen et al., 2010). Mild or attenuated strains can also be generated by thermal treatment, random mutagenesis by using chemicals as nitrous acids and selection or directed mutagenesis in viral RNA silencing suppressors (Ziebell and Carr, 2010). Cross-protection assays can be evaluated by real-time qPCR with probes specific for each virus variant (Ruiz-Ruiz et al., 2009b; Hanssen et al., 2010) and SSCP analysis (Sambade et al., 2002). However, the protection exerted by the mild isolate can be overcome and even a more severe disease can emerge by transmission to a different host species, interaction with other viruses in mixed infections, or recombination between divergent strains or viruses (Fulton, 1986). Therefore cross-protection should be used only for devastating diseases when other protection measures fail, and the process should be monitored closely.

A given clinical patient note does not have to contain information about the presence or absence of a given phenotype. "Night sweats" is a  phenotype class from the Human Phenotype Ontology. It is defined as follows:  "Occurrence of excessive sweating during sleep." Answer this question: Does the clinical patient note below contain information about the presence or absence of the phenotype in the patient? Patient note: "Brachydactyly type A-1 (BDA-1; MIM 112500) is characterized by shortening or missing of the middle phalanges (Fig. 1a). It was first identified by Farabee in 1903 (ref. 2), is the first recorded example of a human anomaly with Mendelian autosomal-dominant inheritance and, as such, is cited in most genetic and biological textbooks. Here we show that mutations in IHH, which encodes Indian hedgehog, cause BDA-1. We have identified three heterozygous missense mutations in the region encoding the amino-terminal signaling domain in all affected members of three large, unrelated families. The three mutant amino acids, which are conserved across all vertebrates and invertebrates studied so far, are predicted to be adjacent on the surface of IHH."

Correct the following text: In Lotus japonicus, some types of abiotic stress conditions, such as UV, salinity or nitrogen deficiency increased isoflavonoid content, but not the flavonol content (Kaducová et al. 2019). However, other types of abiotic stress mainly drought, but also salinity also induced the accumulation of quercetin glycosides (García-Calderón et al. 2015; Mrázová et al. 2017). In those non-legume species that do not accumulate isoflavonoids, UV light induced the synthesis of flavonol compounds. E.g. in Ligustrum vulgare (Agati et al. 2011); Vitis vinifera (Berli et al. 2010), petunia (Ryan et al. 2002), and Arabidopsis (Stracke et al. 2010; Kusano et al. 2011). 
The aim of the present work was to determine the changes in accumulation of major flavonoids and isoflavonoids under abiotic stress in soybean leaves. The accumulation of flavonols and isoflavones is compared at UV stress and Cu toxicity. The results obtained are incorporated into the overall context concerning the specific response of legumes to abiotic stress.

Could You continue a following text, add few sentences as a conclusion. The text is here: High ammonia, another nitrogen source, showed a negative effect on macrophyte occurrence in natural conditions and toxicity symptoms in laboratory conditions. These include decreased chlorophyll content, increased peroxide content and accumulation of phenolic compounds. M. spicatum exhibited slightly higher tolerance to ammonium compared to C. demersum. M. spicatum was able to growth even at 1000 µM ammonium (for 3 weeks at pH=7.5), whereas at 500 µM ammonium the shoots of C. demersum were severely fragmented and damaged (Paľove-Balang et al. 2016; Eliášová at al. 2021). Additionally, M. aquaticum has been found to have higher tolerance to ammonium compared to C. demersum, and M. spicatum has been found to have slightly higher tolerance than C. demersum. Laboratory experiments also suggested that the accumulation of flavonoids with antioxidant properties was induced by ammonium. A detailed LC\/MS analysis of the major flavonoids in C. demersum showed, that tricetin, present mainly as a monoglycoside in the crude extracts, was the most abundant. Other flavonoids present in considerable amounts included luteolin, selgin, apigenin, tricin, and chrysoeriol glycosides. Tricetin, which has antioxidant properties, was also found to be the most inducible by ammonium. However, at high ammonium concentrations the plant tissues were strongly damaged and the production of antioxidants declined.

Correct the following text, prefer british english, if possisble. Text: Isoflavone content is controlled by multiple genes and influenced by environmental factors (Chu et al. 2017), including drought (Lozovaya et al. 2005), light condition (Kirakosyan et al. 2006), fertilisation (Kim et al. 2005; Vyn et al. 2002) temperature and CO2 levels (Kitamura et al. 1991; Kim et al. 2005; Lozovaya et al. 2005). Cold and osmotic stress increased the levels of isoflavones (daidzin, genistin, daidzein, genistein) in roots of soybean seedlings (Swigonska et al. 2014). High temperature stress led to the accumulation of different isoflavones during seed development, and to the expression of key genes encoding enzymes involved in isoflavone synthesis (Chennupati et al. 2012). The increase in isoflavone content in germinating soybean is dose-dependent and accompanied by the increased activities of the key enzymes in isoflavone biosynthesis (Ma et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2019). On the other hand, a reduction in seed isoflavone concentration was determined during a period of water stress (Gutierrez-Gonzalez et al. 2010). Seed isoflavone content dropped dramatically due to water stress, high temperature and solar radiation (Carrera and Dardanelli 2015).

The accuracy and statistical power boost provided by low-coverage
WGS is achieved with the use of genotype imputation from a reference panel of haplotypes, a step aimed at refining uncertain genotype likelihoods and filling in the gaps between sparsely mapped
reads. Current methods for low-coverage sequencing imputation
are not well suited for the size of the new generation of reference
panels, leading to prohibitive running times and therefore to a
drastic reduction in the number of potential applications. To alleviate this problem, we present GLIMPSE, a method for haplotype
phasing and genotype imputation of low-coverage WGS datasets
that reduces the computational cost by several orders of magnitude
compared to that of other methods, allowing accurate imputation based on large reference panels. The efficiency of GLIMPSE
is achieved by combining advanced data structures (PBWT15)
designed to handle large reference panels with a new powerful linear time sampling algorithm. As a consequence, the computational
time to impute a variant decreases with the size of the reference
panel, an important property since larger reference panels are constantly made available.
Projects aimed at sequencing thousands of individuals using
high-coverage WGS, such as Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine30
or gnomAD21, represent the next generation of reference panels
and motivate the need to create computational methods that can
leverage information from thousands of very densely sequenced
individuals. As the size and quality of the reference panel increases,
researchers will be able to improve the imputation performance of
their datasets, especially at rare variants. Imputation accuracy in the
case of low-coverage WGS is a complex function of the sequencing
coverage, the size of the reference panel and how well the panels
represent the ancestry of the target samples. Larger reference panels
lead to longer haplotype matches, suggesting a possible reduction in
the required level of coverage to achieve specific levels of accuracy.
We believe that low-coverage WGS provides multiple key advantages over SNP arrays. First, in terms of accuracy since SNP arrays
lack a substantial proportion of rare variants and suffer from ascertainment bias; the included variants are biased toward populations
involved in the design process of the array. Low-coverage imputation overcomes both these problems: it provides better typing of
low-frequency variants independently of the population of interest, without losing power at common variants as illustrated by our
proof-of-principle eQTL analysis. Second, in terms of study design
since the choice of the SNP array requires considering the density of
the array and the population of interest. In contrast, only the sequencing depth needs to be considered in the case of low-coverage WGS.
Finally, in terms of financial cost; it has recently been shown that
sequencing a genome at 1× coverage is at least as expensive as using
a sparse SNP array (for example, the Illumina HumanCoreExome
array) or half the price of a dense SNP array (for example, the
Illumina Infinium Omni2.5) (ref. 7). So far, this financial advantage
has been undermined by the prohibitive computational costs of the
previous generation of imputation methods. GLIMPSE solves this
problem by performing imputation in a cost-efficient manner: a
genome sequenced at 1× coverage is imputed from the HRC reference panel for less than US$1 on a modern computing cluster.
Even though this is one order of magnitude higher than standard
pre-phasing and genotype imputation pipelines for SNP arrays, this
remains a small fraction of the total cost involved in low-coverage
WGS. Overall, our results suggest that WGS at 1× coverage followed
by GLIMPSE imputation could constitute an interesting alternative
to the densest SNP arrays in terms of cost and accuracy.

We have shown that GLIMPSE already represents an efficient
solution for the imputation of low-coverage WGS. However, we
think that further method developments are still possible. Indeed,
GLIMPSE relies on the existence of a reference panel and on genotype likelihoods computed from the sequencing reads. While reference panels are already available for multiple human populations,
this is not always the case and we think that our model can be naturally extended to perform imputation without a reference panel
since the current method already leverages information from the
target dataset. Of note, this latter property may be particularly useful when the reference panel is substantially smaller than the target
panel: in this case the target samples can serve as their own reference panel. Additional efforts are also required to improve genotype likelihood calculation and data management. This involves the
development of specific file formats to store genotype likelihoods,
which could exploit the sparsity inherent to low-coverage datasets
for data compression. Furthermore, running times can be further
decreased by implementing techniques successfully adopted in the
context of SNP array imputation, such as delayed imputation25 and
the use of compressed file formats for reference panels16,25. This
might further reduce the computational gap between the two imputation approaches.
As NGS gets more economically sustainable, the use of
low-coverage sequencing for future genomic studies could potentially become more popular in the near future. This has not been
possible so far, partly due to the cost of sequencing and the lack of
efficient computational methods able to impute low-coverage WGS
data. To facilitate this transition, we provide a complete open source
software suite that covers the full process of phasing and imputation
of low-coverage sequencing datasets for a wide range of applications
in genetics.

Please corerect the following text: The most important result of the project can be considered the knowledge that Lotus sp. soy also accumulates isoflavonoids as defense substances in case of abiotic stress, which serve as an alternative to flavonols (primarily quercetin derivatives). Their biosynthesis is regulated by increasing the expression of key interactions of their biosynthesis and is under the control of MYB factors. As part of the project, mutants of the model species Lotus japonicus myb15, myb13 and myb36 were obtained and characterized, which are promising in further research into the defense capabilities of plants of the Fabaceae family and their response to abiotic stress.

- Although it is less than a decade old, CRISPR-Cas9 has demonstrated unprecedented potential to revolutionize innovation in basic science. From viruses and bacteria [50, 51] , to simple model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) [52] , Anopheles gambiae (mosquito) [53] , Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) [54] , Hydra magnipapillata (hydra) [55] , Caenorhabditis elegans (round worm) [56] , Danio rerio (zebra fish) [57] , and Arabidopsis thaliana (rockcress) [58] , to larger animals such as pigs [59] , cattle [60] , and monkeys [61] , and even human zygotes [62, 63] , CRISPR experimentation has led to novel, important findings. Such benefits include at least the following: increased overall efficiency in gene editing compared with previous genomic engineering techniques like transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and zinc finger nucleases (ZNFs) [64] ; significant insights into the evolutionary transformation of fish fins into tetrapod limbs [65] ; investigation into new organisms [66] ; genetic and epigenetic screens [67, 68] ; the creation of novel cell lines [69] ; high-throughput screens and libraries [70] ; the elucidation of novel genomic and epigenomic regulatory pathways [71, 72] ; insights into the development of butterfly coloring and patterning [73] ; the functional characterization of key genes and molecular signaling pathways [74, 75] ; and drug-targeting screens [76, 77] . Data from such experimentation provide essential clues and understanding that promote biomedical discovery, advancement, and the basis for potential medical benefits. One of the major controversies about CRISPR technology emerges from its possible application in human embryos. This controversy is not about CRISPR itself, but instead is largely due to the lack of clarity about the status of the human embryo. Although some in the scientific community maintain that it is ethically impermissible to experiment on human embryos after 14 days [78, 79] , it is impossible for any one party-whether it is a government, laboratory, funding agency, panel of experts, court, religious organization, or other group-to decide the status of a human embryo [80, 81] and whether and precisely when it has "personhood" [82] : Is the entity merely a ball of cells whose status is like that of human skin, which sheds regularly without further ado? Or does the entity hold complete personhood status-with irreducible, inalienable moral rights and to whom we owe important directed duties? Or is the embryo's status characterized optimally as something in between? And if so, which moral rights might this entity hold, and which duties might we owe to it? Despite this perplexing complexity, decisions one way or the other must be executed, because proceeding with research or failing to do so has important consequences: Banning or significantly limiting research on human embryos stymies progress at least by mak

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) found a significant
association between T Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (T-ALL) and several
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a gene of unknown function,
URSULA.
Thinking that this is a great example of “low hanging fruit” (i.e. instant
PhD), you decide to pursue research on URSULA. Fortunately, URSULA is also
present in mice. You find that the gene is highly expressed in the brain and
thymus but is not expressed in peripheral T cells. Your PI thinks that the gene
may have a role in T cell development, so she asks you to examine the DN1-4,
double positive (DP), and single-positive (SP) populations in the thymus for
URSULA expression.
a) How will you isolate each DN subset and test for URSULA expression?
