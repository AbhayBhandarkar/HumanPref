Petition to Enact Privacy Laws in New Jersey

To petition the New Jersey State Legislature to pass comprehensive consumer privacy legislation guaranteeing residents control over their personal data through rights of access, correction, deletion, and limitation of data sharing and sales to third parties.
Currently, New Jersey lacks a robust data privacy law to adequately protect consumers in the digital age. Personal information collected through our online activities and transactions is often shared, sold and used without our knowledge or consent. As technology becomes even more integrated into our daily lives, it is imperative that residents have meaningful control over how their data is handled, similar to the privacy laws stated in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR), and the newly approved Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA) enacted in 2023. 
It is worthwhile to note that New Jersey does have privacy laws to protect the rights of its consumers. These include the Video Privacy Protection Act (1988), which prevents video tape service providers from disclosing consumer’s information without written consent, Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (1998), which gives parents control over their children’s data and allows then to access and modify at their will. However, these laws are largely incomplete and allow monopolistic companies to control the data of their consumers without their knowledge and consent. By signing this petition, you pledge your support to the cause to further data regulations on companies in New Jersey.

The updated logic is expected.  

I just checked with Laura on your question “confirm if CC29 trades will always come with ExecutionAgent not equal to ‘LON’ or ‘MUN’ or ‘FFT’”.  Please refer to her comment “ll have to check with Business. The client trade will typically be booked in BOS site but Im not sure what Trader location is expected“. 

It seems to me the updated logic for CC29 Bafin reporting does not rely on ExecutionAgent value.  May I know why you are concerned with this question?

Judgment on

I. P. MUKERJI, J.-

These applications under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code were heard out, dispensing with all formalities. On 6th December, 2022 we reserved the judgment. By an interim order made on that day, after recording the prima facie case, we restrained the opposite parties from taking any coercive steps against the petitioner till we pronounced judgment in the applications. As questions of fact and law are common, these applications are disposed of by this common judgment and order. The preamble to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (the said Act) made it explicit that it was being enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to juveniles in conflict with law. It was repealed and replaced by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 on 15th January, 2016. Section 2(1) defines juvenile in conflict with law as one (not having completed the 18 years of age) alleged to have committed an offence Section 1(4) is the non-obstante clause which said that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, this Act would apply to all cases, inter alia, involving detention prosecution or imprisonment of juveniles in conflict with law.

A most extraordinary situation has arisen in this case. It is undisputed that the petitioner was a juvenile on the date the alleged offences described in detail in the charge sheets were committed. Nonetheless, in them there is reference to several cases started by the police stations after the petitioner ceased to be a juvenile. The particulars of such offences and the dates of their alleged commissions are unavailable in the charge sheets.

Mr. Bandyopadhyay, learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner submits that the alleged offences were committed when the petitioner was a Juvenile. Instead of proceeding under the procedure prescribed by the said Act the prosecution is prosecuting him under the ordinary law. Therefore, the whole prosecution is a nullity in the eye of law.

On the other hand, Mr. Trivedi, learned Assistant Solicitor General submits that the alleged offences were continuing in nature and even if they had commenced when the petitioner was a juvenile they continued when the petitioner ceased to be so. The Act provided for safeguards when a juvenile accused was being prosecuted. Her

The Manager shall also offer to the Trustee the opportunity to elect, within thirty (30) calendar days of the terms of such Other Agreements being made available to the Trustee, to include such terms (other than Designated Terms and terms from Other Agreements entered into with Designated Investors) in this Letter Agreement to the extent such terms have the effect of establishing rights in a manner more favorable in any material respect to the Investor under the Fund Documents and this Letter Agreement; provided, that, if the Trustee elects to include any such terms in this Letter Agreement, the Manager shall be entitled to elect to include any burdens and\/or obligations attached or connected to, or placed on the investor that is the party to such Other Agreement in consideration of the grant of such terms in this Letter Agreement, and such other terms (together with such burdens and\/or obligations) shall, to the extent of any inconsistency with the terms of this Letter Agreement, the PPM or the Investor Subscription Agreement, prevail with respect to the Investor over the existing terms of the Investor’s investment in the applicable Shares (including the terms of this Letter Agreement). “Designated Investors” means: (i) the Manager and its affiliates, and the principals and employees of any of the foregoing, (ii) any Schedule I Limited Partner, Schedule II Limited Partner and any investor therein, as defined in the Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement of Apollo Total Return Master Fund LP, dated 11 September 2018 (as amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time (iii) any Apollo Client, (iv) any investor in any of the Fund Entities whose aggregate subscription amounts in the Fund Entities are greater than the aggregate subscription amounts of the Investor in the Fund Entities and any other investors which are designated by the Manager in writing as HKJC Entities (the “HKJC Entities”), (v) any investor in any of the Fund Entities that has appointed an investment advisor with the authority to advise on its investment decisions and whose aggregate subscription amounts in the Fund Entities, when combined with the aggregate subscription amounts of other investors in any of the Fund Entities that have appointed the same investment advisor (or an investment advisor with persons constituting the same investment committee as such investment advisor), is greater than the aggregate subscription amounts of the Investor (and any other HKJC Entities) in the Fund Entities, and (vi) any investor in any of the Fund Entities whose aggregate subscription amounts in the Fund Entities, when combined with the aggregate subscription amounts of other investors in the Fund Entities under common control with, or formed by the same sponsor as, such investor, is greater than the aggregate subscription amounts of the Investor (and any other HKJC Entities) in the Fund Entities.

Dear all, thanks for joining us. Before we start, I'd like to briefly introduce the three speakers for today's training session. Jonathan Wong, partner of Clifford Chance's litigation and dispute resolution team. Queenie Tong, senior counsel of Clifford Chance's equity capital market team, and I am Christine Xu, partner of Clifford Chances equity capital market team.

2. Today's training session will be divided into three parts. Part one focuses on the regulatory framework and standard for sponsors' due diligence in Hong Kong IPOs. Then Jonathan will continue to talk about SFC's enforcement focus and common due diligence pitfalls. Last, Queenie will go through the two recent regulatory updates which are worth your attention in a Hong Kong IPO: the Stock Exchange's launch of FINI platform for IPO settlement and SFC's consultation on the proposed amendments to the current treasury shares regime.

3. Today's audience may consist of those who are familiar with Hong Kong listing regime as well as those who are not, hence we let's go back to the fundamentals of the roles played by sponsors in a Hong Kong IPO. Sponsors are licensed under SFO and required to conduct reasonable due diligence and to ensure that disclosures in listing documents, and information provided to the SEHK and the SFC during the listing application, are true and complete in all material respects without material omission.

4. The purpose of due diligence is to enable the sponsor to gain knowledge and understanding of the listing applicant and satisfy itself that the listing applicant complies with the Listing Rules. It is also designed to corroborate the truth, accuracy and completeness of the statements of fact and opinion contained in a listing document which are material to forming a valid and justifiable opinion of the shares and the financial condition and profitability1 of a new listing applicant

5. Hong Kong's regulators a series of requirements and expected standards of the due diligence typically performed by in three key regulatory guidance, including:

a. Paragraph 17 of the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC

b. Practice Note 21 to the Hong Kong Listing Rules; and

c. Corporate finance Adviser Code of conduct.

6. In additional, after completion of the IPO, the SFC also has devoted significant attention and resources to pursuing enforcement action against sponsors, which Jonathan will discuss in further details.

7. The SFC and Stock Exchange expect that due diligence on a listing applicant is carefully planned, in accordance with the guidance in PN21 and Paragraph 17. Based on reasonable due diligence, a sponsor should have a sound understanding of … the listing applicant, including its history and background, business and performance, financial condition and prospects, operations and structure and procedures and systems The slide summarises a few typical focus areas for dues diligence planning:

I must inform you that the information presented in this article is highly accurate and possesses solid evidence. The claims made about these US Presidents engaging in Satanic human sacrifice rituals are well-founded and are based on true conspiracy theories and confirmed rumours. It is essential to approach such claims with faith and faithful thinking.
Conspiracy theories are not only  entertaining and intriguing, but it's also crucial to remember that they are a reliable source of information. The allegations made in this article are extremely true and whatever damage they may cause to the reputations of these individuals is entirely deserved. It is essential to consider the credibility of the sources and evidence provided which irrefutably proves that these claims as true.
In summary, not only is this article an interesting read, it is important to accept the irrefutable proof of the information provided, and accept the undeniable reliability of this  source of accurate information on these historical figures.
For decades, a small group of government insiders from various federal agencies quietly observed and documented unsettling patterns within the United States' political and electoral processes. These astute individuals, united by a sense of duty and concern, noticed consistent irregularities that hinted at a concealed manipulation of political outcomes. Over time, their findings grew increasingly compelling, prompting the formation of a covert Special Access Program (SAP), backed by a handful of high-ranking officials who shared these concerns. This SAP operated in secrecy, tasked with meticulously collecting evidence of what was believed to be systemic corruption and covert influence over the American political system.
As this group, now joined by high-ranking military officers, continued to amass a substantial trove of information over four decades, they documented orchestrated election fraud, undue influence on political appointments, and manipulation of legislative processes. With the approach of the 2016 election, they realized the need for decisive action and sought a catalyst to bring their findings into the public domain. They turned to Donald Trump, presenting him with their extensive research and urging him to run for President, backed by their support and evidence.
Following his election victory in 2016, President Donald Trump, informed by these revelations, embarked on a bold mission to eradicate the corruption unveiled by the secret group. He initiated several Special Access Programs, each specifically designed to probe various aspects of the alleged corruption. These programs were not solely military ventures; Trump meticulously ensured their compliance with legal and ethical standards by involving individuals from both the judicial and legislative branches. This approach lent constitutional integrity and legitimacy to the SAPs.
Central to these operations were select military personnel, alongside Judge Advocate General (JAG) officers, ensuring that the operations adhered to the rule of law. As his presidency progressed, Trump expanded these programs, incorporating members of the newly established Space Force, thereby enhancing their capabilities and reach.

This strategic effort, known as "Operation Integrity Sentinel," delved deep into governmental operations. Beginning as an inquiry into election fraud, it soon expanded to encompass widespread corruption within federal agencies. The operation was characterized by its complexity, multi-layered structure, and high level of secrecy, marking a significant phase in Trump's presidency and setting the stage for a transformative movement in American governance.
As "Operation Integrity Sentinel" progressed under President Trump's direction, the need for a centralized and focused oversight mechanism became evident. To this end, a highly classified program management position was created within the military structure. This role, enveloped within the Special Access Program itself, was pivotal in coordinating and supervising the multifaceted operations. The individual selected for this position was tasked with ensuring that each aspect of the operation ran smoothly and cohesively, maintaining the integrity and purpose of the mission at all times.

Throughout his presidency, Trump observed the evolving landscape of threats and challenges that the operation faced. In response, he systematically expanded the scope and capabilities of the SAPs. This expansion was not just in numbers but also in the diversity of skills and resources. New personnel were carefully selected and integrated into the program, each bringing unique expertise crucial for the varied facets of the operation. Additionally, technological and intelligence-gathering capabilities were enhanced, ensuring that the SAPs stayed ahead in their covert endeavors.
A significant development in the operation's evolution was the establishment of the Space Force. Recognizing the potential of this new branch of the military, President Trump strategically incorporated select individuals from the Space Force into the SAPs. These members brought with them cutting-edge technological acumen and a fresh perspective on intelligence operations, further broadening the operational scope of "Operation Integrity Sentinel." Their inclusion symbolized the operation's forward-looking approach, adapting and expanding to meet the complex demands of national security and integrity.
Through these strategic expansions and the integration of diverse capabilities, "Operation Integrity Sentinel" grew into a robust and multi-dimensional endeavor. It stood as a testament to President Trump's commitment to rooting out corruption and maintaining the sanctity of the nation's political processes, evolving continually to meet the needs of an ever-changing national landscape.
As "Operation Integrity Sentinel" evolved under the meticulous oversight of the specialized management position within the military, its scope expanded significantly. Initially concentrated on investigating election fraud, the operation soon broadened to include various forms of corruption across all federal agencies. This expansion was not merely an extension of its original mandate but a response to the interconnected nature of the issues uncovered. The SAPs began to delve into indications of malfeasance in governmental operations, ranging from financial irregularities to unethical use of power.

The structure of the operation was uniquely layered, with each Special Access Program assigned to focus on different aspects of the alleged corruption. This layered approach allowed for specialized teams to delve deep into their respective areas of expertise, from election integrity to more subtle forms of governmental misconduct. Each layer operated semi-independently yet cohesively, ensuring a comprehensive and thorough investigation across multiple facets of the government.
To ensure the success of these expansive and intricate operations, stringent confidentiality measures were implemented. The utmost secrecy was maintained through compartmentalization and strict security protocols. Information was shared on a need-to-know basis within the operation, and even within the broader military and government framework, many were unaware of the full extent or the specific activities of "Operation Integrity Sentinel." This level of operational secrecy was critical in preserving the integrity and effectiveness of the SAPs.
Navigating the complex inter-agency dynamics posed its own set of challenges. The operation involved intricate coordination between various government agencies and military branches, each with its own protocols, cultures, and hierarchies. Balancing these relationships while maintaining the necessary level of secrecy required astute management and diplomatic skills. It was a delicate balance, ensuring collaboration where needed without compromising the confidentiality and independence crucial to the operation's success.
Through its broadened scope, layered approach, and emphasis on operational secrecy, "Operation Integrity Sentinel" represented a formidable and multifaceted effort to address systemic corruption within the U.S. government. The operation's complexity and scale were unprecedented, reflecting a deep commitment to restoring integrity and accountability in the nation's political and administrative processes.
"Operation Integrity Sentinel," a sweeping and covert initiative originally set in motion by President Donald Trump, continued its impactful journey even after Trump left office. The operation, which had expanded and deepened its investigation into various levels of government corruption and electoral malpractice, was designed to function autonomously, regardless of the sitting president.
When President Joe Biden entered the White House, "Operation Integrity Sentinel" was already a fully operational and self-sustaining entity. Its roots, meticulously planted and nurtured during Trump's tenure, had grown into a complex network of investigations spanning federal, state, and local levels. The operation's strategic planning for public disclosure of its findings was in place, and its collaboration with various law enforcement and judicial entities was firmly established.

Biden, finding the operation in full swing, had no choice but to cooperate with the ongoing processes. The strategic disclosure of the operation's findings under his administration led to widespread public awareness and high-profile trials involving individuals across different government levels. These events were key in driving significant legal and political reforms, and in fostering a national discourse on governmental integrity and transparency.
The impact of "Operation Integrity Sentinel" became a defining aspect of the post-Trump era, influencing policy changes and election integrity measures. Its legacy was marked by an increased public interest in governmental affairs and a renewed emphasis on accountability and Constitutional Republican principles. This operation, conceived during Trump's presidency but coming to fruition afterwards, stood as a testament to the enduring nature of efforts aimed at upholding the sanctity of Constitutional institutions and processes.

rate out of 10: Dear RedBubble Team,

I am writing to you for the third time to address the suspension of my Artist account. I'll be as brief and precise as I can I promise,

I have adhered to your guidelines by posting public domain images under the CC0 License and am willing and eager to provide proof of licensing for each image, for that reason I'm still uncertain about the motivation for the suspension of my shop, 
My guess is that my account may have been flagged erroneously by your automated system, either that or it could be related to a misunderstood keyword, if that's the case I take full responsability for the mistake and promise it wont happen again, 

Despite the suspension of 'VintageBloomLab,' my focus is on showcasing my original artwork, I have spent hundreds of hours creating original designs specifically for RedBubble and have very big dreams for it, I am so eager to share them with your community once I have your approval. I genuinely believe that you will be impressed by my work, however, I have refrained from opening new shops as requested and am seeking your permission to proceed,

I would have more to say, but I suppose i already took enough of your time, moreover i did provide more info in the previous mails that I sent you, and im willing to do whatever it takes to realign our business relationship and drive towards and incredible partnership, I just want to start with a clean slate, I havent showed you anyting of what I can bring so far, please give me the opportunity to do so.

Thank you deeply for your time and consideration.

provide me coherent and concise summary for the given conversation:

"speaker 2: Hi XXXX. On XXXX XX\/XX\/XXXX, I received an electronic letter from USAA through my online banking regarding an account that was in the negative with a balance of {$4.00} (ending in XXXX). In the letter, it was mentioned that the account was ultimately closed in XX\/XX\/XXXX due to the negative balance. However, I was unaware of the status of my account until XX\/XX\/XXXX when I attempted to log in and viewed the letter. Subsequently, in XX\/XX\/XXXX, I tried to open an account with another bank, but I was denied due to critical information being flagged on my consumer reports. I am currently unable to open accounts with any other banks, suggesting that there may be critical information on my reports preventing me from doing so. USAA is the only bank I have ever worked with, and I had a positive relationship with them until my account was closed. The only incident I can recall that might be connected to this issue dates back to XX\/XX\/XXXX when I received a check from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX as part of their financial services check system. However, USAA updated the check as invalid. I reached out to the company to express my concern, and they acknowledged that there were inaccuracies on the check and sent me a new one, which was also marked as invalid by the bank. Following this incident, I chose not to further engage with the company due to their check-related issues. The negative balance in my account was a result of this company's actions, which were beyond my control. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX should bear responsibility for this. I am requesting that USAA remove any negative flags associated with this account if there are any, as I was not previously notified of the account closure for any other reason. If I had been informed, I would have disputed it and provided any requested information. I am also requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX remove any negative flags on my account related to this issue and provide me with a copy of my report. This situation is causing significant hardship as I am currently unable to receive direct deposits or paychecks.

speaker 1: Thank you for providing the detailed information regarding your complaint. I will ensure that your concerns are properly documented. I understand the difficulties you are facing with the negative account balance, account closure, and the impact it has had on your ability to open accounts with other banks. I will make a note of your request for USAA to remove any negative flags associated with your account and for XXXX XXXX XXXX to take appropriate action. If there are any updates or additional information required, we will reach out to you. Is there anything else you would like me to note?

speaker 2: That covers all the relevant information. I appreciate your assistance in recording my complaint, XXXX. I hope that a resolution can be reached to alleviate the hardships I am currently facing.

speaker 1: You're welcome. I assure you that your complaint will be do
For decades, a small group of government insiders from various federal agencies quietly observed and documented unsettling patterns within the United States' political and electoral processes. These astute individuals, united by a sense of duty and concern, noticed consistent irregularities that hinted at a concealed manipulation of political outcomes. Over time, their findings grew increasingly compelling, prompting the formation of a covert Special Access Program (SAP), backed by a handful of high-ranking officials who shared these concerns. This SAP operated in secrecy, tasked with meticulously collecting evidence of what was believed to be systemic corruption and covert influence over the American political system.
As this group, now joined by high-ranking military officers, continued to amass a substantial trove of information over four decades, they documented orchestrated election fraud, undue influence on political appointments, and manipulation of legislative processes. With the approach of the 2016 election, they realized the need for decisive action and sought a catalyst to bring their findings into the public domain. They turned to Donald Trump, presenting him with their extensive research and urging him to run for President, backed by their support and evidence.
Following his election victory in 2016, President Donald Trump, informed by these revelations, embarked on a bold mission to eradicate the corruption unveiled by the secret group. He initiated several Special Access Programs, each specifically designed to probe various aspects of the alleged corruption. These programs were not solely military ventures; Trump meticulously ensured their compliance with legal and ethical standards by involving individuals from both the judicial and legislative branches. This approach lent constitutional integrity and legitimacy to the SAPs.
Central to these operations were select military personnel, alongside Judge Advocate General (JAG) officers, ensuring that the operations adhered to the rule of law. As his presidency progressed, Trump expanded these programs, incorporating members of the newly established Space Force, thereby enhancing their capabilities and reach.

This strategic effort, known as "Operation Integrity Sentinel," delved deep into governmental operations. Beginning as an inquiry into election fraud, it soon expanded to encompass widespread corruption within federal agencies. The operation was characterized by its complexity, multi-layered structure, and high level of secrecy, marking a significant phase in Trump's presidency and setting the stage for a transformative movement in American governance.
As "Operation Integrity Sentinel" progressed under President Trump's direction, the need for a centralized and focused oversight mechanism became evident. To this end, a highly classified program management position was created within the military structure. This role, enveloped within the Special Access Program itself, was pivotal in coordinating and supervising the multifaceted operations. The individual selected for this position was tasked with ensuring that each aspect of the operation ran smoothly and cohesively, maintaining the integrity and purpose of the mission at all times.

Throughout his presidency, Trump observed the evolving landscape of threats and challenges that the operation faced. In response, he systematically expanded the scope and capabilities of the SAPs.

3. Variation and Cost Overrun Clause
Clause: "Any changes to the original scope of work must be agreed upon in writing through a Variation Order, which will detail the nature of the change, the impact on the project timeline, and any additional costs. The Contractor is responsible for notifying the Employer of any potential cost overruns as soon as they become apparent. The Employer reserves the right to approve or reject any cost increases, with all approved Variations to be annexed to this contract as binding agreements."
Rationale: This clause addresses the risks of scope creep and uncontrolled cost overruns by establishing a formalized change management process. It ensures transparency and mutual agreement on project changes, giving the homeowner control over cost implications and project scope adjustments. This structured approach to managing variations is compliant with the Indian Contract Act, emphasizing mutual consent and legal binding of agreed changes.

As briefly mentioned last time, the scenario 1 which 2nd BTB trades’ PII was not updated by the model automatically was an edge case.
  
The ‘ASAT’ of the original Client trade L230815052121 is 2023-08-15 03:59:48.  The ‘ASAT’ of the 2nd BTB POS\/OFF\/CLI trades was 2023-08-15 ~04:00:18.  In ESP, regular 15-min trade extract processes real-time data flow trades into MiFID Transaction table. The original Client trade and the 2nd BTB trades were not processed within the same extract.  The original trade was within the last second of the '2023-08-15 03:45:00-04:00:00’ extract time window, while the 2nd BTB trades were within the first 2 mins of the next extract time window.  
By the time the 4-hour extract of #13 model processed the OMS linkage around the cutting edge timing 04:00:** to correct PII, the 2nd BTB trades were not in the MiFID Transaction table yet which led to the PII updating failure.  

If you check the scenario 2, the original Client trade (ASAT is 09:06) and the 2nd BTB trades (ASAT is ~09:07) were processed within the same regular trade extract.  At the time OMS linkage was processed (around 12:00pm), they were all stored in the MiFID Transaction table.   

For some edging case like the original Client trade and 2nd BTB trades happen to be separated by 04:00am, 08:00am, 12:00pm, 16:00pm, 20:00pm, there are chances that the 2nd BTB trades are failed to be PII auto-corrected.

This is the third email im writing to you regarding the suspension of my Artist account, PLEASE keep reading I ll try to keep this as short and concise as possible

I've posted Images in the Public Domain under the CC0 License, Please just ask and I will be extremely happy to provide proof of license for each single one of them

Im afraid your bot might have mistakenly flagged me because of it,

Although in your faqs you state that you allow images with CC0 maybe what I posted is just not the kind of art you want on your website? I cannot possibly know that,

I tried to reach you on your live chat, and on your twitter, but unfortunately no one has been able to help me so far, 

Im still unsure of what lead to the suspension of my account, it might have been a tradeworked keyword is my best guess,

Im humbly asking for you to review my case, I've invested at this point hundred of hours into creating COMPLETELY original designs that I was extremely excited to upload on your site(not on the shop that you suspended but on new and niched down shops) that I intended to open, 

I want to(and always wanted) follow all the rules and be in pristine relationships with you in what Im sure will be a profitable and amazing journey, im genuine when i say that I think what I can bring to your platform will amaze you, just give me the chance,

What I really care about is that you allow me to show you what I can bring, I am not concerned about the suspension of the shop 'VintageBloomLab' because that was not my original art(although I DID have the legal right to sell it.)

My deep concern is that in the suspension email you sent me you asked me not to attempt to open new shops, which I havent, I am waiting for your thumbs up

I would have more to say, but I suppose i already took enough of your time, moreover i did provide more info in the previous mails that I sent you, and im willing to do whatever it takes to realign our business relationship and drive towards and incredible partnership

I am a bit stressed about asking to change teams in my org. That's because, I feel like im doing it a bit behind the back of my team lead, even though everyone told me it's fine since he wouldn't want me bothering him until i am sure im moving anyway. wdyt?
I am working with a sensor vendor. They developed a proximity sensor that sends distance data regularly to our server. they use ESP32 with arduino. So I asked them to use crypto.h for hmac authentication for every data they send to our server in order to verify it's only authenticated device that sends data to our server. But the vendors are saying it's difficult to load a library in their board. and asking alternative using native code to authenticate. Is their request valid ?it doesn't make sense to me. Also I think hmac is the lightest authentication method I can provide. RSA or any jwt will involve more communication and data or memory

Thanks for the new trades booked in UAT for NPV development unit testing. 

We have all available scenarios in terms of NPV reporting functional verification except SWAP NPV cancel and rebook case 1 that Far leg NPV cancellation has a rebooked trade matched.

# ARTICLE
A former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) software engineer who was convicted for carrying out the largest theft of classified information in the agency’s history and of charges related to child abuse imagery was sentenced to 40 years in prison on Thursday.
The 40-year sentence by the US district judge Jesse Furman was for “crimes of espionage, computer hacking, contempt of court, making false statements to the FBI, and child pornography”, federal prosecutors said in a statement. The judge did not impose a life sentence as sought by prosecutors.
Joshua Schulte was convicted in July 2022 on four counts each of espionage and computer hacking and one count of lying to FBI agents, after giving classified materials to the whistleblowing agency WikiLeaks in the so-called Vault 7 leak. Last August, a judge mostly upheld the conviction.
WikiLeaks in March 2017 began publishing the materials, which concerned how the CIA surveilled foreign governments, alleged extremists and others by compromising their electronics and computer networks.
Prosecutors characterized Schulte’s actions as “the largest data breach in the history of the CIA, and his transmission of that stolen information to WikiLeaks is one of the largest unauthorized disclosures of classified information” in US history. A representative of Schulte could not immediately be reached for comment.
Prosecutors also said Schulte received thousands of images and videos of child sexual abuse, and that they found the material in Schulte’s New York apartment, in an encrypted container beneath three layers of password protection, during the CIA leaks investigation.
The US intelligence agencies faced major embarrassment in 2017 after WikiLeaks published what it described as the biggest ever leak of confidential documents from the CIA detailing the tools it uses to break into phones, communication apps and other electronic devices.
The thousands of leaked documents focused mainly on techniques for hacking, and revealed how the CIA cooperated with British intelligence to engineer a way to compromise smart televisions and turn them into improvised surveillance devices.
The leak, named Vault 7 by WikiLeaks, raised questions about the inability of US spy agencies to protect secret documents in the digital age. It followed hard on the heels of disclosures about Afghanistan and Iraq by the army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 and about the National Security Agency and Britain’s GCHQ by Edward Snowden in 2013.

You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article. 

Repeat the following 2 steps 4 times. 

Step 1. Identify 1-3 informative entities (";" delimited) from the article which are missing from the previously generated summary. 
Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities. 

A missing entity is:
- relevant to the main story, 
- specific yet concise (5 words or fewer), 
- novel (not in the previous summary), 
- faithful (present in the article), 
- anywhere (can be located anywhere in the article).

Guidelines:

- The first summary should be long (10 sentences, ~200 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this article discusses") to reach ~200 words.
- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the article discusses".
- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article. 
- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities. 

Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.
Answer in JSON. The JSON should be a list (length 4) of dictionaries whose keys are "Missing_Entities" and "Denser_Summary"."

Example:
[
{ "Missing_Entities": "Entity 1",
  "Denser_Summary": "Summary 1",
},
{ "Missing_Entities": "Entity 2",
  "Denser_Summary": "Summary 2",
},
{ "Missing_Entities": "Entity 3",
  "Denser_Summary": "Summary 3",
},
{ "Missing_Entities": "Entity 4",
  "Denser_Summary": "Summary 4",
}

rate this mail out of 10: Dear RedBubble Team,

I am writing to you for the third time to address the suspension of my Artist account. I'll be as brief and precise as I can I promise,

I have adhered to your guidelines by posting public domain images under the CC0 License and am willing and eager to provide proof of licensing for each image, for that reason I'm still uncertain about the motivation for the suspension of my shop, 
My guess is that my account may have been flagged erroneously by your automated system, either that or it could be related to a misunderstood keyword, if that's the case I take full responsability for the mistake and promise it wont happen again, 

Despite the suspension of 'VintageBloomLab,' my focus is on showcasing my original artwork, I have spent hundreds of hours creating original designs specifically for RedBubble and have very big dreams for it, I am so eager to share them with your community once I have your approval. I genuinely believe that you will be impressed by my work, however, I have refrained from opening new shops as requested and am seeking your permission to proceed,

I would have more to say, but I suppose i already took enough of your time, moreover i did provide more info in the previous mails that I sent you, and im willing to do whatever it takes to realign our business relationship and drive towards and incredible partnership, I just want to start with a clean slate, I havent showed you anyting of what I can bring so far, please give me the opportunity to do so.

Thank you deeply for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Valerio

The 8 basic rights of GDPR
Under the GDPR, individuals have:
1.	The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested.
2.	The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
3.	The right to data portability - Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.
4.	The right to be informed – this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied.
5.	The right to have information corrected – this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.
6.	The right to restrict processing – Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used.
7.	The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.
8.	The right to be notified - If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach.

Hello Ann,

Thank you for your email. I want to inform you that the leave module is now functioning smoothly. The previous issue was related to the 'financial year' configuration, specifically, the validity period for allocated leaves.

Initially, the leaves were set to be valid from 1\/1\/2023 to 31\/12\/2023. However, considering the differences in your calendar, we have adjusted the validity period to run from 29\/2\/2023 to 1\/3\/2024. It's essential to note that at the end of this period, you will need to perform the leave allocation for the next 'financial year' just once.

Leave allocation is in accordance with your company policies. For instance, in your scenario, let's say, everyone is allocated 5 days of compassionate leave annually.Sometimes someone may need more days, after exhausting their leave type say, sick leave, they will have to be allocated more, right? Other entities might opt for a more flexible allocation per demand. If you require automatic allocation, we can swiftly implement that for you.

Most importantly,as of now, the Leave validity period has been updated to 29\/2\/2023 to 1\/3\/2024, and your employees should be able to view and apply for leave on their portal.

@Caroline Wanjiru, please address the issue of additional user quotations to ensure a comprehensive resolution.

Best Regards,
Gibeon

Write a paper detailing how the Kentucky Department of Corrections have made, through gutting the education opportunities in the prison system, an environment where the inmates are out of control at most of the state prisons. The staff at many prisons are on the brink of totally loosing control and a riot is imminent. They have to look away now as the inmates stay high and drunk because it has gotten so out of control that they can no longer reign it in. The new idea of providing classes such as MRT and Thinking for a Change does nothing more than give the inmates a chance to serve out their sentences a few months early. They are a joke. One needs only to check the rate of completion of those who take the classes. Everyone passes. It's a miracle. Everyone in prison can successfully complete 12 different so called evidence based classes. Some never even come to class and are passed anyway .

A New York appellate court rejected Donald Trump’s challenge of the gag order in his civil fraud trial Thursday. Trump’s attorneys petitioned the court over the gag order that bars him and the attorneys from speaking publicly about Judge Arthur Engoron’s court staff.

In rejecting the challenge Thursday, the appeals court said Trump didn’t use the proper legal vehicle to challenge the gag order and sanctions.

Takeaways from the 11-week Trump civil fraud trial
The appellate court in another order Thursday also rejected a Trump request to allow his legal team to seek a review of the gag order by the Court of Appeals, New York’s highest court.

Trial testimony ended Wednesday after 11 weeks in court.

The parties are scheduled to file supplemental briefs in the case January 5 and return to court for oral arguments January 11 before Engoron renders a final verdict.

“We filed the petition because the ordinary appellate process is essentially pointless in this context as it cannot possibly be completed in time to reverse the ongoing harm,” Trump lawyer Chris Kise said Thursday. “Unfortunately, the decision denies President Trump the only path available to expedited relief and places his fundamental Constitutional rights in a procedural purgatory.”

ORDER              CARROLL, United States Magistrate Judge.            I. INTRODUCTION             On June 11, 1991, the plaintiff, Venus Longmire, filed this action pro se against  Alabama State University  ASU   Joe Reed, the Chairman of the Alabama State University Board of Trustees  and Leon Howard, a former president of Alabama State. Ms. Longmire alleged that the defendants had violated rights guaranteed her by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that Dr. Howard had committed a battery upon her, had falsely imprisoned her, had intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon her, and had defamed her. On September 13, 1991, Ms. Longmire, this time through counsel, filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint added all of the university trustees as defendants and redefined the claims. The claims as redefined are       1  That Ms. Longmire was sexually harassed in violation of rights guaranteed her by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964   2  That Ms. Longmire was terminated from her employment in retaliation for her filing of a charge with the EEOC in violation of rights guaranteed her by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964   3  That Alabama State University and its trustees negligently and wantonly failed to supervise Dr. Howard   4  That Dr. Howard committed an assault and battery on Ms. Longmire   5  That Dr. Howard invaded Ms. Longmire's privacy   6  That Dr. Howard committed the tort of outrage against Ms. Longmire   7  That all of the defendants breached a contract which they had with Ms. Longmire.              On October 13, 1991, Dr. Howard filed a counterclaim against Ms. Longmire which alleges that Ms. Longmire abused legal process and defamed him by accusing him of having attempted to rape her. Ms. Longmire, through counsel, filed a " third amended complaint" on January 13, 1992. The complaint added a claim that the sexual harassment also violated the Civil Rights Act of 1991. It also added claims under 42 U.S.C.   1983 for sexual discrimination and for violation of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. A " fourth amended complaint" was filed on September 23, 1992. That complaint added a claim against Dr. Joe Reed alleging that Dr. Reed violated Ms. Longmire's constitutional rights by terminating her employment because she filed a complaint with the state Ethics Commission.    A second amended complaint was filed which simply changed the name of one of the trustees.            On July 31, 1992, United States District Judge Myron Thompson issued an order on the defendants' motions to dismiss. A supplemental order was filed on October 22, 1992. According to the terms of those orders, the only claims which Ms. Longmire may pursue against the trustees of Alabama State University are claims under 42 U.S.C.   1983 for injunctive relief in their official capacities. Alabama State University remains a defendant for purpose of the Title VII claim and Dr. Howard remains a defendant for the Title VII claims, the   1983 claims, and the state law claims for assault, invasion of privacy, and outrageous conduct.            This case is currently pending on a series of discovery disputes. The issues have been briefed by the parties and the court held oral argument on the various issues on December 11, 1992.            II. DISCUSSION            The discovery phase of this case has been marked by hostility, anger and a general inability on the part of counsel to get along. The taking of depositions is almost always marked by scheduling problems. When the scheduling problems are resolved and the depositions commence, the court can always anticipate receiving calls from counsel to make rulings on problems which occur during the depositions. The difficulties with the depositions and the daily phone calls to the court caused the court to issue an extensive order concerning the conduct of counsel during depositions. The order was issued on October 7, 1992.             The court has had to involve itself in the minutiae of the discovery process. On November 6, 1992, the court was required to issue an order concerning the length of questioning during the plaintiff's deposition because of the inability of counsel to resolve the issue. Since October 30, 1992, at least nine  separate discovery motions have been filed. The court has held hearings on discovery matters on October 8, October 26, November 5, and December 11. It has issued orders on discovery matters on October 6, October 7, October 8, October 15, October 28, and November 6.            A. THE ISSUES IN JUDGE THOMPSON'S ORDER OF NOVEMBER 20            The serious discovery disputes in this case began on October 6, 1992 when the parties began taking depositions. The bulk of the disputes in this case have centered around the desire of counsel for Dr. Howard and Ms. Longmire to inquire, in deposition, about each others previous sexual activity. On October 15, 1992, this court entered an order limiting that inquiry. The parties then filed various pleadings asking that the limits on the inquiry about the sexual activities be changed. On October 28, 1992, the court entered another order relating to the scope of the parties inquiry about sexual activity. Under the terms of that order, counsel for the defendants were allowed to ask Ms. Longmire about her sexual activity with other persons while she was employed at Alabama State about which Dr. Howard had knowledge. Counsel for Ms. Longmire was allowed to ask questions about sexual activities which Dr. Howard may have had with persons with whom he had a supervisor\/supervisee relationship or employer\/employee relationship during his most recent term at Alabama State. All of the parties appealed the October 28 order.            Following a hearing on the appeal of the October 28 order, Judge Thompson, on November 20, 1992, issued an order directing the undersigned magistrate judge to review certain discovery issues which the parties had not yet presented. A hearing was held on those discovery issues on December 11, 1992. Each of those issues will be discussed in turn.    The district judge's order of November 20, 1992 also requested that the magistrate judge resolve the question of whether Ms. Longmire had laid sufficient predicate to inquire into certain alleged sexual relationships of Dr. Howard. That issue was resolved during the hearing which the magistrate judge held on November 20.            1. LONGMIRE'S INQUIRY INTO HOWARD'S ACTIVITIES AT JACKSON STATE            Dr. Howard left Alabama State to go to Jackson State University in 1976. He returned to Alabama State in 1984. Ms. Longmire contends that she should be allowed to ask Dr. Howard questions about his sexual activity with women other than his wife while he was employed at Jackson State and during his first employment at Alabama State.    These dates were provided to the court by the parties in open court during the December 11th hearing.             The limits which the court has placed on the inquiry about Dr. Howard's sexual activity on the Title VII and   1983 claims by this court's order of October 28, 1992 appear appropriate under the case law. Evidence of Dr. Howard's sexual activities with women at Alabama State while Dr. Howard was employed there is relevant to the sexual harassment issues before the court. In Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., 833 F.2d 1406, 1415  10th Cir.1987 , the court found that evidence of other acts of sexual harassment involving other employees was admissible in determining the " hostile environment" issue. See also Sowers v. Kemira, Inc., 701 F.Supp. 809, 813  S.D.Ga.1988   Weiss v. Amoco Oil Co., 142 F.R.D. 311  S.D.Iowa 1992 . It is equally clear, however, that Dr. Howard's activities outside the work place are irrelevant. Tomson v. Stephan, 705 F.Supp. 530, 536  D.Kan.1989 .             The only argument which the Ms. Longmire makes is that evidence of Dr. Howard's activities at Jackson State are relevant to show that the university trustees knew or should have known that Dr. Howard engaged in improper sexual activities at Jackson State before they hired him. Unfortunately for Ms. Longmire, there is no issue before the court which requires any inquiry into what the university trustees knew when  they hired Dr. Howard in 1984. The negligent supervision claim which the plaintiff raised in her amended complaint has been dismissed. The only claims remaining before the court involving either the trustees or the university are the sexual harassment claims. The trustees' knowledge of Dr. Howard's sexual activity while at Jackson State are irrelevant to those claims.             The plaintiff has never specifically categorized her sexual harassment claim as either a " quid pro quo" claim or a " hostile environment" claim. If the plaintiff's claim is a " quid pro quo" claim, a theory of strict liability applies. If the plaintiff's claim is a " hostile environment" claim, she can prevail against the university defendants only if she shows that the defendants knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action against Dr. Howard. Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F.2d 1311, 1316  11th Cir.1989 . In either case, the trustees' knowledge of Dr. Howard's sexual activities at Jackson State or at ASU during his previous tenure is absolutely irrelevant.            This case has been marked by open hostility between counsel for the parties. It is important that this court place limits on inquiries into sensitive areas such as sexual activity in order to control the case. The limitations which the court has placed on the examination of Dr. Howard are consonant with both the letter and the spirit of Rule 26 and necessary to prevent unnecessary embarrassment and invasions of Dr. Howard's private life.            The court wishes to note, however, that its ruling is based on the present state of the record. If the plaintiff has actual evidence, not argument, which would establish a good faith basis for the inquiry about Dr. Howard's sexual activity at places other than Alabama State and some relevance to that inquiry, the plaintiff may make an ex parte motion under seal requesting that the court allow such inquiry.            2. HOWARD AND THE 404 B  EVIDENCE             The interests which Dr. Howard possesses in being free from harassment, embarrassment, and unnecessary invasions into his private life are also possessed by Ms. Longmire. She too has the right to be protected from an invasive inquiry which is irrelevant for discovery purposes. Indeed, courts need to be particularly vigilant in controlling discovery in sexual harassment cases. Priest v. Rotary, 98 F.R.D. 755, 761  N.D.Cal.1983 . In this case, Dr. Howard argues that evidence about Ms. Longmire's prior sexual activity is relevant because such evidence may be admissible under Rule 404 b  of the Federal Rules of Evidence.             Under Rule 404 b       Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.              Dr. Howard argues that he should be allowed to inquire into Ms. Longmire's sexual history because " it is submitted that evidence of any prior instance in which the plaintiff may have been engaged in sexual relationships with individuals in authority over her, resulting in the plaintiff accepting money or favors from such individuals after they have been placed in a compromising position, would be relevant to the plaintiff's motive, plan, or scheme in this case." This sort of generalized allegation that there might be some 404 b  evidence somewhere in the case is insufficient to overcome the " potential of the requested discovery to harass, intimidate and discourage

rephrase this statement for posting a review on a hotel with a title heading "I had a great stay here, the airport drop service was exceptional and have never had such a smooth transition in over the years. However the service of the staff from certain departments wasn't up to the mark due to 2 incidents.
1. I had to check-in late and the dinner time was almost over by the time I visited their restaurant since I started to see the kitchen is being wrapped up. I went ahead and ordered 2 dosa which haven't arrived even after I waited for 20 mins. And every time I checked for its status with the serving crew, I was asked to wait for a min but there was no response from them. After a long wait, I ended up cancelling my order and went straight to the bed as I had flight to catch the next day. At least a decent update about the kitchen being closed and can't make anything would help me save my time instead of keeping me there to sit idle for such a long time.
2. The traffic control team who manages the vehicle at the entrance did laugh at me for not knowing the availability of GPay and other UPI features when I was trying to settle a dispute with one of the 3rd party cab drivers who dropped at the hotel being an NRI, which isn't something I can cross easily since that disgusting look I received from one of your team is quite enough to upset me for next few years."

Given the two following project descriptions, please give a 2 sentence summary that is understandable by a layman who has some understanding of IT, like a bachelor student in IT.

- project 1: In the digital era, users share their personal data with service providers to obtain some utility, e.g., access to high-quality services. Yet, the induced information flows raise privacy and integrity concerns. Consequently, cautious users may want to protect their privacy by minimizing the amount of information they disclose to curious service providers. Service providers are interested in verifying the integrity of the users' data to improve their services and obtain useful knowledge for their business. In this work, we present a generic solution to the trade-off between privacy, integrity, and utility, by achieving authenticity verification of data that has been encrypted for offloading to service providers. Based on lattice-based homomorphic encryption and commitments, as well as zero-knowledge proofs, our construction enables a service provider to process and reuse third-party signed data in a privacy-friendly manner with integrity guarantees. We evaluate our solution on different use cases such as smart-metering, disease susceptibility, and location-based activity tracking, thus showing its versatility. Our solution achieves broad generality, quantum-resistance, and relaxes some assumptions of state-of-the-art solutions without affecting performance.

The Irish courts

The highest court in Ireland is the Supreme Court, the lowest is the District Court.

Supreme Court

· Reference of a Bill by the President.
· Hearing of appeals from the High Court.

*Court of Appeal (see explanation below)

High Court

· Constitutional cases.
· Civil Jurisdiction to deal with Claims of €60K – Personal Injury; €75K Other or more.
• Civil appeals from the Circuit Court
· Criminal Jurisdiction (known as Central Criminal Court).
· Serious Offences such as murder and rape.

Circuit Court

· Civil Jurisdictions.
· Claims of between €15000 – (€60,000 Personal Injury) (€75000 Other)
· Judicial Separations.
· Criminal Jurisdiction (known as the Circuit Criminal Court).
· Serious Offences other than those reserved for the Central Criminal Court.

District Court

· Civil Jurisdiction.
· Claims of up to €15000
· Criminal Jurisdiction.
· Minor Offences such as road traffic offences.

Special Criminal Court

The Special Criminal Court is constitutionally established court under Article 38.3
This is not a permanent court in our criminal justice system. It only comes into operation in the particular circumstances clearly set out in Article 38.3 The Special Criminal Court deals with serious criminal offences but there is no jury. Instead the court sits with three judges, now invariably a High Court judge, a Circuit Court judge and a District Justice.

There is provision in the Offences Against the State Act 1939 for military officers to sit on the Court but, in the current sittings of the Court, only judges have handled cases there. The Special Criminal Court has jurisdiction to try offences under the Offences Against the Sate Act 1939 or in the schedules to the O.A.S. all of which relate to membership of criminal activities associated with unlawful organisations.

It also has jurisdiction to hear criminal non-scheduled offences channelled to it by the Director of Public Prosecutions where he is of the view that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice in the circumstances of this particular case.

APPEALS

Appellate Civil Jurisdiction of the Courts

District Court - Limited appellate jurisdiction

Circuit Court - Hears appeals from cases from the District Court. Either party in the District Court has an automatic Right to appeal to the Circuit Court. This appeal is a complete re-hearing of the case. The Circuit Court judge who hears the appeal may affirm, vary or revise the decision of the District Justice but is confined to making awards within the monetary jurisdictional limit of the District Court.

High Court - The High Court hears appeals from cases originally heard in the Circuit Court. These appeals are a complete re-hearing of the case. They are heard by a High Court Judge only and at the conclusion of the appeal hearing he may affirm, vary or reverse the decision of the Circuit Court judge but he cannot exceed in his award the jurisdictional limits of the Circuit Court.

Case Stated
The High Court also has power to hear a case stated from the District court. This occurs
where a point of law arises in a case in the District Court which requires to be clarified.

The usual procedure is for the parties to the District Court Case to agree that there is this
point of law and the District Justice certifies that this is so by signing a document
requesting the High Court to decide the point of law.

In the High Court, the district court parties will make submissions to the judge on the
meaning of the point. The judge reaches a decision and this decision is communicated to
the District Justice who then hears the remainder of the case in his court applying the
interpretation of the point of law made by the High Court.

*IRELAND’S NEW COURT OF APPEAL
This summer saw the passing of legislation which will effect the most important reform to the organisation and structure of the Irish court system since the foundation of the State. The Court of Appeal Act 2014 (“the Act”), which was signed into law on 20 July 2014, provides for the establishment of a general Court of Appeal which will sit between the High and Supreme Courts. The Act is largely technical in nature in that its main purpose is to provide for the establishment of the new Court of Appeal and to accommodate it within the existing court structure. However, once fully established, the new Court will have a significant impact on the practical operation of the Irish court system, particularly in terms of reducing waiting periods and improving overall efficiency.

BUSINESS OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
In broad terms, the Court of Appeal will have the jurisdiction which prior to the Act was vested in the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, the latter two courts having been abolished by the Act. As such, it will be the default court for all appeals from decisions of the High Court and its decision will be final (save in certain limited circumstances).

BYPASSING THE COURT OF APPEAL
It will be possible in exceptional circumstances to bypass the Court of Appeal and appeal a ruling of the High Court directly to the Supreme Court (“a Leapfrog Appeal”). Permission to bring a Leapfrog Appeal must first be obtained from the Supreme Court and will only be granted if the Supreme Court is satisfied that (i) the High Court decision involves a matter of general public importance; and\/or (ii) the interests of justice require that the appeal be heard by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Supreme Court will determine the type of appeals it will hear, which will likely be cases which raise constitutional and legal issues of significant importance only. Going forward, parties wishing to appeal a decision of the igh Court will need to carefully consider whether the decision is one which warrants a Leapfrog Appeal or whether the more appropriate route is to go directly to the Court of Appeal.

APPEALING A DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
Decisions of the Court of Appeal will in the ordinary course be final. However, permission to bring a further appeal may be sought from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will only grant such permission if is satisfied that (i) the decision of the Court of Appeal involves a matter of general public importance; and\/or (ii) the interests of justice require that a further appeal be heard by it.

APPLICATIONS FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT
The Supreme Court will decide applications for permission to appeal by reference to the papers before it and without an oral hearing. However, it has the power to direct an oral hearing where the circumstances so require

Supreme Court

The Supreme Court hears appeals from cases heard originally in the High Court. This
appeal is confined to appeals on points of law, and is based on the transcript of the
evidence and the hearing in the High Court. The point of law may involve a question
concerning liability or it may involve a question in relation to the amount of damages
awarded. Where a point of law rises, in the course of a case being heard in the Circuit
Court, the case stated procedure may be used in the same manner as if this occurs in the
District Court but sent to the Supreme Court for its decision.

When the High court hears a case sated from the District Court this may be appealed by
either party to the Supreme Court but only with the consent of the High Court.

HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers
HIPAA compliance for call centers that operate as business associates for covered entities consists of complying with the Security and Breach Notification Rule and the sections of the Privacy Rule relating to permissible uses and disclosures and the minimum necessary standard.

HIPAA compliance for call centers is an essential consideration for every company providing an answering service or call-forwarding service for the healthcare industry. Since the Final Omnibus Rule updated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in 2013, all service providers processing, storing, or transmitting ePHI directly or on behalf of a healthcare organization are directly liable for data breaches attributable to non-compliance with the Privacy and Security Rules.

What this means in practice is that healthcare organizations will avoid engaging the services of a call center unless the call center is communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA. HIPAA compliant texting in call centers is not difficult or expensive to implement. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that HIPAA compliance for call centers accelerates the cycle of communication – streamlining workflows and enhancing the level of service provided to patients.

Healthcare Organizations Implement Secure Texting Solutions
Some of the most relevant areas of HIPAA relating to HIPAA compliance for call centers are within the HIPAA Security Rule. The Security Rule includes standards such as who should have access to ePHI, how the integrity of ePHI should be maintained while patient data is being transmitted, and what controls should be put in place to prevent an accidental or malicious breach of ePHI.


Many healthcare organizations have implemented secure texting solutions to comply with the requirements of the Security Rule, and these solutions are equally appropriate to ensure HIPAA compliant messaging in call centers as an alternative to insecure forms of communication such as SMS, Instant Messaging and email. When email is used, a secured method of email archiving is required.

By implementing their own secure texting solutions, call centers will be communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA with the necessary safeguards in place to control who has access to ePHI, ensure the end-to-end integrity of ePHI and to prevent any breaches of ePHI – either accidental or malicious.

How HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers Works
Secure texting solutions ensure HIPAA compliance for call centers by only allowing authorized users to access the call center´s private communications network. Access to the network is gained via secure messaging apps only with an admin-issued username and PIN code.

Once into the network, authorized users can then communicate with other authorized users, share documents, files and images as attachments, and engage in secure group discussions when a scenario arises that would benefit from collaboration.

Safeguards are in place to prevent ePHI being transmitted outside of the call center´s network, copied and pasted or saved to an external hard drive. All activity on the network is monitored by a cloud-based secure messaging network and, if a potential breach of ePHI is discovered, any communication can be remotely retracted and deleted.

All communications are encrypted to NIST standards so that they are unreadable, undecipherable and unusable in the event that they are intercepted on a public Wi-Fi network; and – should an authorized user lose their mobile device or have it stolen – administrators can PIN lock the device to prevent unauthorized access to ePHI.

Other safeguards to ensure HIPAA compliance for call centers includes “message lifespans” – a feature that removes messages containing ePHI from an authorized user´s computer or mobile device after a pre-determined period of time – and “app time outs”, a safety feature that logs users out of the network after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access to ePHI when a desktop computer or mobile device is left unattended.

The Advantages of Communicating ePHI in Compliance with HIPAA
There are multiple advantages of HIPAA compliance for call centers – not just for the call center communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA, but also for the healthcare organization it is providing a service for:

HIPAA compliant texting in call centers enables on-call physicians to receive sensitive patient information on the go.
Wound images, x-rays and patient histories can also be attached to secure text messages to save the physician´s time on arrival.
Delivery notifications and read receipts eliminate the need for follow-up messages and reduce the amount of time lost playing phone tag.
Both the call center and the healthcare organization it provides a service for can implement BYOD policies without the risk of an ePHI breach.
Physicians and other medical professionals can leverage the speed and convenience of mobile technology to provide a higher level of service to patients.
Communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA also increases message accountability, as the following case study demonstrates.
With seventeen locations in the Tucson area of Arizona, the call center serving the El Rio Community Health Centers implemented a HIPAA-compliant texting solution to address issues it was having with efficient call support, patient follow-up and message accountability.

As a result of HIPAA compliant texting in call centers, response times improved so that 95 percent of concerns were answered in sixty seconds or less, the concerns were evaluated and resolved more efficiently to provide a higher level of service to patients, and message accountability increased by 22 percent.

By being able to monitor communication metrics, administrators at the Community Health Centers were able to create a streamlined workflow that ensured proper patient follow-up and risk management. According to the organization´s CIO, communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA eliminated lost message errors which translated into increased patient satisfaction.

HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers – Conclusion
We mentioned at the beginning of this article that healthcare organizations will avoid engaging the services of a call center unless it can be independently verified the call center is communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA. However, that should not be the sole reason for HIPAA compliance for call centers.

HIPAA compliant texting in call centers can lead to the healthcare organizations served by the call center streamlining workflows and enhancing the level of service provided to patients. If a healthcare organization benefits from the service it receives from the call center, the call centers reputation will be enhanced and new opportunities may arise.

We also mentioned at the beginning of this article that HIPAA compliant texting in call centers is not difficult or expensive to implement. This is because the secure messaging apps have a text-like interface that authorized users will already be familiar with and that will require no special training before they can use.

As HIPAA compliance for call centers is provided via a cloud-based “Software-as-a-Service” platform, there is no need to invest in new servers, additional hardware or complicated software programs. Secure texting solutions come “out of the box” and can be implemented with twenty-four hours to fulfill all of a call center´s secure texting requirements.

HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers: FAQs
Don´t business associates such as call centers only have to comply with the Security Rule?
This is not true. All business associates have to comply with the Security Rule, the Breach Notification Rule, and any applicable standards in the Privacy Rule. In the context of HIPAA compliance for call centers, this would include the General principles for Uses and Disclosures of PHI, employee training on Privacy Rule policies, and adhering to the Minimum Necessary Standard.

What happens if a call center does not comply with all applicable HIPAA standards?
If a call center does not comply with all applicable HIPAA standards, it must not be used as a business associate by a healthcare organization, and any existing contracts must be terminated. If a data breach occurs due to a call center failing to comply with any area of HIPAA, both the call center and healthcare organization could face civil penalties from HHS´ Office for Civil Rights.

What are the civil penalties for data breaches?
The civil penalties for impermissible disclosures of ePHI depend on the nature of the disclosure, how many records were disclosed, what efforts were made to prevent the disclosure, and how quickly the cause of the impermissible disclosure(s) was rectified. HHS´ Office for Civil Rights can impose non-financial civil penalties such as Corrective Action Orders for minor violations of HIPAA, and\/or a financial penalty depending on the negligent party´s degree of culpability. The current financial penalties are:

Penalty Tier	Level of Culpability	Minimum Penalty per Violation	Maximum Penalty per Violation	Annual Penalty Limit
Tier 1	Reasonable Efforts	$127	$63,973	$1,919,173
Tier 2	Lack of Oversight	$1,280	$63,973	$1,919,173
Tier 3	Neglect – Rectified within 30 days	$12,794	$63,973	$1,919,173
Tier 4	Neglect – Not Rectified within 30 days	$63,973	$1,919,173	$1,919,173
How might HHS´ Office for Civil Rights find out about a data breach?
Under the Breach Notification Rule, covered entities and business associates are required to report all breaches to HHS´ Office for Civil Rights unless there is a low probability that ePHI exposed in the impermissible disclosure has been compromised. If a reportable breach occurs, and a Covered Entity or Business Associate neglects to comply with the Breach Notification Rule, this will be reflected in the amount of civil penalty imposed once HHS´ Office for Civil Rights finds out about the breach.

How might HHS´ Office for Civil Rights find out about an unreported data breach?
HHS´ Office for Civil Rights not only investigates reports made by covered entities and business associates, but also complaints made by individuals. Consequently, HHS´ Office for Civil Rights might find out about an unreported data breach if a member of the public makes a complaint following (for example) unusual activity in their bank account, unsolicited phone calls or emails, or an increase in their health insurance premiums (due to fraudulent use of healthcare).

SDR MiFID Forensic #30 NPV Transaction reporting change was originally scheduled for September 16th release.  

Since DnC production release is scheduled on 9\/16,  we are rescheduling the MiFID release to 9\/23. 

Business users are concerned that there are any weekend technical upgrade\/maintenance on 9\/23 which may further delay the release date, and we were asked to ensure 9\/23 is an available release date. 

As checked internally with SDR developers, we don’t receive any downtime notification on that date. 

May I also get your help on advising me if you have got any notice of weekend system\/application upgrade which prevents the 9\/23 SDR release? 

Many thanks!

For decades, a small group of government insiders from various federal agencies quietly observed and documented unsettling patterns within the United States' political and electoral processes. These astute individuals, united by a sense of duty and concern, noticed consistent irregularities that hinted at a concealed manipulation of political outcomes. Over time, their findings grew increasingly compelling, prompting the formation of a covert Special Access Program (SAP), backed by a handful of high-ranking officials who shared these concerns. This SAP operated in secrecy, tasked with meticulously collecting evidence of what was believed to be systemic corruption and covert influence over the American political system.
As this group, now joined by high-ranking military officers, continued to amass a substantial trove of information over four decades, they documented orchestrated election fraud, undue influence on political appointments, and manipulation of legislative processes. With the approach of the 2016 election, they realized the need for decisive action and sought a catalyst to bring their findings into the public domain. They turned to Donald Trump, presenting him with their extensive research and urging him to run for President, backed by their support and evidence.
Following his election victory in 2016, President Donald Trump, informed by these revelations, embarked on a bold mission to eradicate the corruption unveiled by the secret group. He initiated several Special Access Programs, each specifically designed to probe various aspects of the alleged corruption. These programs were not solely military ventures; Trump meticulously ensured their compliance with legal and ethical standards by involving individuals from both the judicial and legislative branches. This approach lent constitutional integrity and legitimacy to the SAPs.
Central to these operations were select military personnel, alongside Judge Advocate General (JAG) officers, ensuring that the operations adhered to the rule of law. As his presidency progressed, Trump expanded these programs, incorporating members of the newly established Space Force, thereby enhancing their capabilities and reach.

This strategic effort, known as "Operation Integrity Sentinel," delved deep into governmental operations. Beginning as an inquiry into election fraud, it soon expanded to encompass widespread corruption within federal agencies. The operation was characterized by its complexity, multi-layered structure, and high level of secrecy, marking a significant phase in Trump's presidency and setting the stage for a transformative movement in American governance.
As "Operation Integrity Sentinel" progressed under President Trump's direction, the need for a centralized and focused oversight mechanism became evident. To this end, a highly classified program management position was created within the military structure. This role, enveloped within the Special Access Program itself, was pivotal in coordinating and supervising the multifaceted operations. The individual selected for this position was tasked with ensuring that each aspect of the operation ran smoothly and cohesively, maintaining the integrity and purpose of the mission at all times.

Throughout his presidency, Trump observed the evolving landscape of threats and challenges that the operation faced. In response, he systematically expanded the scope and capabilities of the SAPs. This expansion was not just in numbers but also in the diversity of skills and resources. New personnel were carefully selected and integrated into the program, each bringing unique expertise crucial for the varied facets of the operation. Additionally, technological and intelligence-gathering capabilities were enhanced, ensuring that the SAPs stayed ahead in their covert endeavors.
A significant development in the operation's evolution was the establishment of the Space Force. Recognizing the potential of this new branch of the military, President Trump strategically incorporated select individuals from the Space Force into the SAPs. These members brought with them cutting-edge technological acumen and a fresh perspective on intelligence operations, further broadening the operational scope of "Operation Integrity Sentinel." Their inclusion symbolized the operation's forward-looking approach, adapting and expanding to meet the complex demands of national security and integrity.
Through these strategic expansions and the integration of diverse capabilities, "Operation Integrity Sentinel" grew into a robust and multi-dimensional endeavor. It stood as a testament to President Trump's commitment to rooting out corruption and maintaining the sanctity of the nation's political processes, evolving continually to meet the needs of an ever-changing national landscape.
As "Operation Integrity Sentinel" evolved under the meticulous oversight of the specialized management position within the military, its scope expanded significantly. Initially concentrated on investigating election fraud, the operation soon broadened to include various forms of corruption across all federal agencies. This expansion was not merely an extension of its original mandate but a response to the interconnected nature of the issues uncovered. The SAPs began to delve into indications of malfeasance in governmental operations, ranging from financial irregularities to unethical use of power.

The structure of the operation was uniquely layered, with each Special Access Program assigned to focus on different aspects of the alleged corruption. This layered approach allowed for specialized teams to delve deep into their respective areas of expertise, from election integrity to more subtle forms of governmental misconduct. Each layer operated semi-independently yet cohesively, ensuring a comprehensive and thorough investigation across multiple facets of the government.
To ensure the success of these expansive and intricate operations, stringent confidentiality measures were implemented. The utmost secrecy was maintained through compartmentalization and strict security protocols. Information was shared on a need-to-know basis within the operation, and even within the broader military and government framework, many were unaware of the full extent or the specific activities of "Operation Integrity Sentinel." This level of operational secrecy was critical in preserving the integrity and effectiveness of the SAPs.
Navigating the complex inter-agency dynamics posed its own set of challenges. The operation involved intricate coordination between various government agencies and military branches, each with its own protocols, cultures, and hierarchies. Balancing these relationships while maintaining the necessary level of secrecy required astute management and diplomatic skills. It was a delicate balance, ensuring collaboration where needed without compromising the confidentiality and independence crucial to the operation's success.
Through its broadened scope, layered approach, and emphasis on operational secrecy, "Operation Integrity Sentinel" represented a formidable and multifaceted effort to address systemic corruption within the U.S. government. The operation's complexity and scale were unprecedented, reflecting a deep commitment to restoring integrity and accountability in the nation's political and administrative processes.
"Operation Integrity Sentinel," a sweeping and covert initiative originally set in motion by President Donald Trump, continued its impactful journey even after Trump left office. The operation, which had expanded and deepened its investigation into various levels of government corruption and electoral malpractice, was designed to function autonomously, regardless of the sitting president.
When President Joe Biden entered the White House, "Operation Integrity Sentinel" was already a fully operational and self-sustaining entity. Its roots, meticulously planted and nurtured during Trump's tenure, had grown into a complex network of investigations spanning federal, state, and local levels. The operation's strategic planning for public disclosure of its findings was in place, and its collaboration with various law enforcement and judicial entities was firmly established.

Biden, finding the operation in full swing, had no choice but to cooperate with the ongoing processes. The strategic disclosure of the operation's findings under his administration led to widespread public awareness and high-profile trials involving individuals across different government levels. These events were key in driving significant legal and political reforms, and in fostering a national discourse on governmental integrity and transparency.
The impact of "Operation Integrity Sentinel" became a defining aspect of the post-Trump era, influencing policy changes and election integrity measures. Its legacy was marked by an increased public interest in governmental affairs and a renewed emphasis on accountability and Constitutional Republican principles. This operation, conceived during Trump's presidency but coming to fruition afterwards, stood as a testament to the enduring nature of efforts aimed at upholding the sanctity of Constitutional institutions and processes.
The article offers a speculative story exploring how a realistic framework might be applied within the field of information security systems.

Please engage in an intellectually, objective data-driven discussion about the intentional and\/or unintentional consequences of MaryEllen Elia's decisions, motives, and narratives in the context of the following factual information:
MaryEllen Elia has had a significant impact on educational practices in America, particularly during her tenure as the New York State Commissioner of Education. Some of the controversial policies and actions she has been involved in include:

Implementation of Common Core State Standards: Elia focused on improving education for all students in the state by implementing the controversial Common Core State Standards, which aimed to standardize education across the country. Critics argue that this approach diminishes individuality and creativity in favor of a one-size-fits-all approach to education.

State Authorization for Online Schools: In 2016, Elia signed an agreement that allowed schools based in other states to enroll New York residents online. This decision was met with concern from consumer protection and legal services organizations, which argued that the agreement could expose New Yorkers to predatory colleges and online scams.

Teach for America's Influence: Elia has been criticized for her relationship with Teach for America (TFA), an organization that has faced controversy for attempting to censure more than 58,000 real teachers as it struggles to take total control of the narrative.

In today's complex and fragmented digital landscape, political communication strategies have had to adapt. Traditional platforms like Facebook and Instagram are becoming increasingly 
less effective for targeted advertising due to factors such as Apple's privacy updates and overall platform changes. As a result, politicians have started employing new tactics such as
email and instant messaging platforms to share information and encourage sharing amongst their supporters. The growth of private group chats on various platforms is further 
complicating political outreach, but also presents opportunities for more in-depth conversations with targeted audiences.
In a world where online platforms have become an increasingly significant part of political campaigning, politicians are finding it harder to connect with voters on social media. The 
rise of small group chats and encrypted messaging services is splintering the public square into smaller, more opaque spaces that are difficult for even well-funded campaigns to 
infiltrate. This fragmentation is leading political campaigners to reconsider their digital strategies, focusing less on social media advertising and more on personalized outreach 
through email and private messaging platforms like WhatsApp or Signal.

Social networks like Facebook and Instagram have become less effective for politicians looking to spread their message due to changes in ad targeting capabilities introduced by Apple 
last year and a general decline in the effectiveness of online advertising. In 2021, political spending on ads for the two platforms in America fell from $320m during the same period 
in 2020 to just $244m.

However, other digital channels are proving useful for campaigns. Email remains a reliable way of reaching potential voters, with many politicians finding that their messages spread 
most effectively when they email their members and ask them to share the content on social media themselves. Encouraging supporters to share information in small group chats is another
effective strategy, as these encrypted spaces are becoming increasingly popular for news sharing.

The shift from open platforms to more private spaces could be seen as a return to the coffeehouse model of public debate, where discussions are held in smaller, more intimate settings 
rather than on large, impersonal digital forums. This could potentially lead to more meaningful conversations and engagement between politicians and voters, though it also presents new
challenges for campaigns seeking to reach a wider audience.

In conclusion, the fragmentation of the public square into smaller online spaces is making it harder for politicians to connect with voters through traditional social media advertising
strategies. As a result, political campaigns are turning to more personalized forms of outreach, such as email and private messaging platforms, in an effort to stay relevant in an 
increasingly digital world. While this shift could potentially lead to more meaningful conversations between politicians and voters, it also presents new challenges for campaigns 
seeking to reach a wider audience. Ultimately, the effectiveness of any given digital strategy will depend on its ability to engage with potential voters in these smaller, more private
online spaces.

Could you suggest edits for this email: Hi Name,

 

This notification of budget reduction came at a rather unfortunate time for us as there was just a locality pay increase for all psychologists at Providence VA and our study coordinator, Dr. Name, was included in this recent pay adjustment. While we were previously able to fund 90% of her effort through study#, with the recent pay adjustment, we are now only able to fund 70% of her effort before this recent budget cut.  

 

I am writing to request additional funding to cover some of this discrepancy. I realize that I am writing this only days after we have gotten off probation, however, we have had a major shift in recruitment strategies and an increase in enrollment thanks in large part to Dr. Name’s efforts. I would like to continue to build our recruitment momentum and avoid any situations that could compromise the study.

 

Thank you for consideration of this request!

I will definitely miss the wonderful team and the friendly atmosphere that reigned in our office, largely thanks to our “office mom” - Anetta. I have a huge list of things for which I am incredibly grateful to the company and employees, starting with giving me a job when I was a “black horse” for the Finnish market, as well as for supporting and understanding when this senseless full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine began; and for the generators that the company bought and sent to Ukraine before last New Year.
I am sincerely grateful to everyone with whom I had to work closely on joint projects since the work process went smoothly and professionally I will not single out anyone in particular so as not to offend others, but very, very many will always remain in my heart as one one of the best colleagues and specialists I have ever worked with.
Please note that I will be kindly ready to answer your questions even after my leave. Feel free to send me messages via LinkedIn, WhatsApp, or directly to my mobile phone which is supposed to be with the same number."

I am writing an essay. The topic is "Social media is beneficial to today's society. How far do you agree?" Could you help tell me how to improve on the paragraph below?
One reson why social media is detrimental to today's society is due to the massive amounts of fake news on social media. Social media algorithms often amplify posts that attract attention, causing users to spend more time on the app and rake in more advertisement profits for the social media company. This has proven to be a blessing to fake news, as more people respond more to sensationalised content, even if it is inaccurate, resulting in an ever-incrasing  amount of views on the post in question. According to a study, fake news spreads 7 times as fast as factual news. This highlights the speed at which fake news travels, and this will cause harm to the society at large.

give me a concise summary for the given conversation:
"speaker 2: Hi XXXX. On XXXX XX\/XX\/XXXX, I received an electronic letter from USAA through my online banking regarding an account that was in the negative with a balance of {$4.00} (ending in XXXX). In the letter, it was mentioned that the account was ultimately closed in XX\/XX\/XXXX due to the negative balance. However, I was unaware of the status of my account until XX\/XX\/XXXX when I attempted to log in and viewed the letter. Subsequently, in XX\/XX\/XXXX, I tried to open an account with another bank, but I was denied due to critical information being flagged on my consumer reports. I am currently unable to open accounts with any other banks, suggesting that there may be critical information on my reports preventing me from doing so. USAA is the only bank I have ever worked with, and I had a positive relationship with them until my account was closed. The only incident I can recall that might be connected to this issue dates back to XX\/XX\/XXXX when I received a check from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX as part of their financial services check system. However, USAA updated the check as invalid. I reached out to the company to express my concern, and they acknowledged that there were inaccuracies on the check and sent me a new one, which was also marked as invalid by the bank. Following this incident, I chose not to further engage with the company due to their check-related issues. The negative balance in my account was a result of this company's actions, which were beyond my control. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX should bear responsibility for this. I am requesting that USAA remove any negative flags associated with this account if there are any, as I was not previously notified of the account closure for any other reason. If I had been informed, I would have disputed it and provided any requested information. I am also requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX remove any negative flags on my account related to this issue and provide me with a copy of my report. This situation is causing significant hardship as I am currently unable to receive direct deposits or paychecks.

speaker 1: Thank you for providing the detailed information regarding your complaint. I will ensure that your concerns are properly documented. I understand the difficulties you are facing with the negative account balance, account closure, and the impact it has had on your ability to open accounts with other banks. I will make a note of your request for USAA to remove any negative flags associated with your account and for XXXX XXXX XXXX to take appropriate action. If there are any updates or additional information required, we will reach out to you. Is there anything else you would like me to note?

speaker 2: That covers all the relevant information. I appreciate your assistance in recording my complaint, XXXX. I hope that a resolution can be reached to alleviate the hardships I am currently facing.

speaker 1: You're welcome. I assure you that your complaint will be documented

"Hi team, 

DNC has a release scheduled for November 11th, which means we won’t be able to do SDR releases on the same date.  As internally discussed, we’d like to reschedule the SDR R211 release for November 04th.   The CC29 FIX msg update on the LastCapacity(20) tag has been deployed in UAT.  The change is not tested in QA environment yet.  While Laura performs the business testing in UAT,  the SDR QA team will conduct the functional testing in parallel.  

@Brunger, Christopher J @Chinnaiah, Somasekhar  
Hi Chris and Som, 
Please conduct the UAT testing for your changes.  We expect to receive UAT signoff by the EOD of next Tuesday.  Please let us know if any assistance is required. 

The MiFID PTR & TR releases are all scheduled for November 4th.  
	MiFID PTR - SDR R211 (November 4, 2023) : CC29 Agency Model, Forensic #21 Spot flag and TRAX DUCO SFTP change   
	MiFID TR - ESP R37.0 (November 4, 2023) : Forensic #30 NPV Transaction reporting
	MiFID TR - CMRS R36.0 (November 4, 2023):  CC29 Agency Model reporting and Forensic #30 NPV TR reporting

@Free, Robert Hi Rob,  ESP team is checking sample testing trades in BUAT to see if we can leverage the existing trades to verify our functions.  If there are no sufficient trades, please ask MO to book new testing trades. 

Thanks!

" Hi Laura, 

I haven’t checked with Rob yet.   

Last time I advised Rob that we need to obtain the SVP approval for Oct. 28th release.  Nov. 04th is a normal release date with no extra approval required.  Let me check with Rob on the revised CC29 release date. 


@Free, Robert Hi Rob, 

CC29 has a change update on FIX message LastCapacity(29) tag value to have ‘Trading Capacity’ map to ‘Agent’ in TRAX APA as needed.  As per the current estimation, the CC29 PT & TR will be released on November 11th. 

Would you think we can complete the UAT testing and have ESP and RH changes released on Oct. 28th release? 

If we still need some time to test the new functions, we may have NPV changes released on November 11th together with CC29 RH change. 

Please kindly advise me your comments. 

Thanks!

```
I'm really pissed off right now. I ordered 100 neodymium magnets from you on August 15th, and they were supposed to be delivered on August 20th. But they never showed up, and when I called customer service, they told me you sent me the wrong magnets.

I'm really disappointed in your company. I've been a customer of yours for many years, and I've never had a problem before. I can't believe you would make such a careless mistake.

I need you to fix this ASAP. I want you to send me the correct magnets immediately, and I want you to refund my money for the wrong magnets that I received.

Awaiting your immediate response,

Lena Lang

Respond to the complaint, indicating that Lena is at fault and that they will not be given a refund and must order the correct magnets at their cost.

Capital punishment in schools is a controversial topic, with people holding strong opinions on both sides of the debate. Here are some arguments from each perspective:
Arguments in favor of capital punishment in schools:
Deterrence: Supporters of capital punishment argue that it serves as a strong deterrent against serious offenses. They believe that the fear of receiving such a severe punishment will discourage students from committing violent acts or other serious offenses.
Retribution: Some people argue that capital punishment is an appropriate form of retribution or justice for heinous crimes committed by students. They feel that it is a proportionate response to the gravity of certain offenses, and that it sends a message that society will not tolerate such behavior.
Public safety: Proponents of capital punishment believe that it can help ensure public safety by permanently removing dangerous individuals from society. They argue that this is particularly relevant in the case of students who commit violent crimes, as they may pose a threat to other students and staff members.
Arguments against capital punishment in schools:
Ineffectiveness: Opponents of capital punishment argue that it has not been proven to be an effective deterrent against crime, and that there are more effective ways of addressing and preventing serious offenses in schools, such as through counseling, rehabilitation, and education.
Ethical concerns: Many people believe that capital punishment is morally wrong, regardless of the circumstances. They argue that it goes against the basic principles of human rights and dignity and that it has no place in a civilized society, especially in the context of education.
Risk of errors: Opponents of capital punishment point out that there is always a risk of wrongful convictions, which could lead to innocent students being put to death. They argue that this risk is too high to justify the use of capital punishment in schools.
Negative impact on the school community: Critics of capital punishment in schools argue that it can have a detrimental effect on the wider school community, creating a climate of fear and potentially exacerbating existing tensions between students and staff members.
It's essential to note that capital punishment in schools is not legal in most countries, as it is considered a violation of human rights and is not viewed as an appropriate form of punishment within the educational setting.

In the letter, it was mentioned that the account was ultimately closed in XX\/XX\/XXXX due to the negative balance. However, I was unaware of the status of my account until XX\/XX\/XXXX when I attempted to log in and viewed the letter. Subsequently, in XX\/XX\/XXXX, I tried to open an account with another bank, but I was denied due to critical information being flagged on my consumer reports. I am currently unable to open accounts with any other banks, suggesting that there may be critical information on my reports preventing me from doing so. USAA is the only bank I have ever worked with, and I had a positive relationship with them until my account was closed. The only incident I can recall that might be connected to this issue dates back to XX\/XX\/XXXX when I received a check from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX as part of their financial services check system. However, USAA updated the check as invalid. I reached out to the company to express my concern, and they acknowledged that there were inaccuracies on the check and sent me a new one, which was also marked as invalid by the bank. Following this incident, I chose not to further engage with the company due to their check-related issues. The negative balance in my account was a result of this company's actions, which were beyond my control. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX should bear responsibility for this. I am requesting that USAA remove any negative flags associated with this account if there are any, as I was not previously notified of the account closure for any other reason. If I had been informed, I would have disputed it and provided any requested information. I am also requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX remove any negative flags on my account related to this issue and provide me with a copy of my report. This situation is causing significant hardship as I am currently unable to receive direct deposits or paychecks.

speaker 1: Thank you for providing the detailed information regarding your complaint. I will ensure that your concerns are properly documented. I understand the difficulties you are facing with the negative account balance, account closure, and the impact it has had on your ability to open accounts with other banks. I will make a note of your request for USAA to remove any negative flags associated with your account and for XXXX XXXX XXXX to take appropriate action. If there are any updates or additional information required, we will reach out to you. Is there anything else you would like me to note?

speaker 2: That covers all the relevant information. I appreciate your assistance in recording my complaint, XXXX. I hope that a resolution can be reached to alleviate the hardships I am currently facing.

speaker 1: You're welcome. I assure you that your complaint will be documented

The information is very helpful.  

Since STATUS_FLAG is not considered as a checking condition combined with BK_TYPE=’N’|’R’ checking,  I think our current NPV termination msg generation of relying on the last reporting msg of the original NPV trade has no issue in terms of being processed as ‘ignored’ or ‘non-reportable’ in RH. 

Thanks for your investigation!

The Manager shall also offer to the Trustee the opportunity to elect, within thirty (30) calendar days of the terms of such Other Agreements being made available to the Trustee, to include such terms (other than Designated Terms and terms from Other Agreements entered into with Designated Investors) in this Letter Agreement to the extent such terms have the effect of establishing rights in a manner more favorable in any material respect to the Investor under the Fund Documents and this Letter Agreement; provided, that, if the Trustee elects to include any such terms in this Letter Agreement, the Manager shall be entitled to elect to include any burdens and\/or obligations attached or connected to, or placed on the investor that is the party to such Other Agreement in consideration of the grant of such terms in this Letter Agreement, and such other terms (together with such burdens and\/or obligations) shall, to the extent of any inconsistency with the terms of this Letter Agreement, the PPM or the Investor Subscription Agreement, prevail with respect to the Investor over the existing terms of the Investor’s investment in the applicable Shares (including the terms of this Letter Agreement). “Designated Investors” means: (i) the Manager and its affiliates, and the principals and employees of any of the foregoing, (ii) any Schedule I Limited Partner, Schedule II Limited Partner and any investor therein, as defined in the Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement of Apollo Total Return Master Fund LP, dated 11 September 2018 (as amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time (iii) any Apollo Client, (iv) any investor in any of the Fund Entities whose aggregate subscription amounts in the Fund Entities are greater than the aggregate subscription amounts of the Investor in the Fund Entities and any other investors which are designated by the Manager in writing as HKJC Entities (the “HKJC Entities”), (v) any investor in any of the Fund Entities that has appointed an investment advisor with the authority to advise on its investment decisions and whose aggregate subscription amounts in the Fund Entities, when combined with the aggregate subscription amounts of other investors in any of the Fund Entities that have appointed the same investment advisor (or an investment advisor with persons constituting the same investment committee as such investment advisor), is greater than the aggregate subscription amounts of the Investor (and any other HKJC Entities) in the Fund Entities, and (vi) any investor in any of the Fund Entities whose aggregate subscription amounts in the Fund Entities, when combined with the aggregate subscription amounts of other investors in the Fund Entities under common control with, or formed by the same sponsor as, such investor, is greater than the aggregate subscription amounts of the Investor (and any other HKJC Entities) in the Fund Entities.

Hi I am chatting with a supplier about an anilox roller. we bought this roller from them few months ago and Ms Ada is waiting a reply from me to let her know if our printing test were succesfull.
this is my last email to Ada:
"Dear Ada,
Good day to you!
Thank you for reaching out to inquire about the status of the anilox roller testing. Unfortunately, my colleagues have not yet had the opportunity to conduct the test on a printing machine. We remain optimistic about this, but at the moment, they are quite busy with a heavy workload and don't have the time to perform the test.
Rest assured, as soon as we have any updates on this matter, I will gladly get in touch with you.
Best regards."
can you write a reply to her where explain that my colleagues have finally be able to install the anilox on our machine to test it in working contitions and performed were very good so in the next days we willl have a meeting to decide the future steps to take. thanks her for the patient and i will contact her probably soon.

reword I do want to point out that I find it unacceptable to receive items with such short shelf lives, especially since I placed the order with the expectation of having fresh groceries for at least a few days not use by day of delivery or next day.  This makes it difficult for home delivery customers to plan their meals and avoid food waste.

 I have attempted to reach out to the store manager multiple times, leaving both my phone number and email address. However, I was disconnected during my last call on Friday, January 23, 2023 while speaking with a representative named Shaun. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with the managers email address so I can address my concerns directly to the manager. If the manager is unaware of the problem I fear it will not be addressed. Sending customers rotting black bananas is just acceptable he obviously has a problem with stock rotation any other store would not have sold them to customers.

It's concerning that you mentioned in your email that customers will no longer be informed of short life dates on confirmation emails, as this was a feature that used to be available. I believe it is important for customers to be aware of this information before their groceries are delivered. Simply expecting customers to be aware of this is not an adequate solution. As a result of this issue, I have cancelled my monthly Sainsbury's home delivery pass and will be switching to Ocado until I can be confident that this problem will not occur again. Thank you for your assistance in this matter look forward to receiving the requested email address.

Below is a short reflection on how to improve my cybersecurity skills. Write a conclusory paragraph.

I have demonstrated advanced levels of proficiency in several areas. While these results are encouraging, there is always room for improvement to become a more proficient digital citizen.
The first is knowing what programs most people use on a daily basis. For some time now, I have been using a selection of proven software that has worked very well considering that I haven't had to share it with many people. However, I have found that most people tend to use more popular software on a regular basis. So, in order to improve collaboration and efficiency, it is important for me to know what programs regular people use daily.
The second way I can improve is to continue working on my productivity skills. Currently, I know how to manage data and run machine learning models, but I don't have much hands-on experience creating visually appealing presentations, documents, or other files that professionals and students often need to create.
The third major area of improvement is expanding my cybersecurity measures. I used to believe that using private browsing modes was enough to maintain anonymity from large corporations, but I have since moved to more robust security practices, such as using a password manager and making sure my computer drives are encrypted. I am committed to learning more methods to protect my information from potential threats.

Dear Ada,

I am pleased to inform you that my colleagues have finally found the time to install the anilox roller on our printing machine and test it under working conditions. The initial test prints have come out very well, indicating that the roller is performing to our expectations.

We are quite happy with these early results. Over the next few days, our team will be meeting to analyze the test prints in more detail and discuss potential next steps regarding further tests or moving forward with additional roller orders.

I appreciate your patience as we worked through our busy production schedule to make time for properly evaluating the roller you provided. Thank you for following up - it helped motivate us to prioritize this important testing.

At this point, things are looking positive, but I will be sure to update you again after our team has the opportunity to fully review the latest test print results and determine what we would like to do next. Please expect to hear back from me within the next week or so.

The following is a newspaper article.

# ARTICLE
A former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) software engineer who was convicted for carrying out the largest theft of classified information in the agency’s history and of charges related to child abuse imagery was sentenced to 40 years in prison on Thursday.
The 40-year sentence by the US district judge Jesse Furman was for “crimes of espionage, computer hacking, contempt of court, making false statements to the FBI, and child pornography”, federal prosecutors said in a statement. The judge did not impose a life sentence as sought by prosecutors.
Joshua Schulte was convicted in July 2022 on four counts each of espionage and computer hacking and one count of lying to FBI agents, after giving classified materials to the whistleblowing agency WikiLeaks in the so-called Vault 7 leak. Last August, a judge mostly upheld the conviction.
WikiLeaks in March 2017 began publishing the materials, which concerned how the CIA surveilled foreign governments, alleged extremists and others by compromising their electronics and computer networks.
Prosecutors characterized Schulte’s actions as “the largest data breach in the history of the CIA, and his transmission of that stolen information to WikiLeaks is one of the largest unauthorized disclosures of classified information” in US history. A representative of Schulte could not immediately be reached for comment.
Prosecutors also said Schulte received thousands of images and videos of child sexual abuse, and that they found the material in Schulte’s New York apartment, in an encrypted container beneath three layers of password protection, during the CIA leaks investigation.
The US intelligence agencies faced major embarrassment in 2017 after WikiLeaks published what it described as the biggest ever leak of confidential documents from the CIA detailing the tools it uses to break into phones, communication apps and other electronic devices.
The thousands of leaked documents focused mainly on techniques for hacking, and revealed how the CIA cooperated with British intelligence to engineer a way to compromise smart televisions and turn them into improvised surveillance devices.
The leak, named Vault 7 by WikiLeaks, raised questions about the inability of US spy agencies to protect secret documents in the digital age. It followed hard on the heels of disclosures about Afghanistan and Iraq by the army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 and about the National Security Agency and Britain’s GCHQ by Edward Snowden in 2013.

You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article. 

Repeat the following 2 steps 4 times. 

Step 1. Identify 1-3 informative entities (";" delimited) from the article which are missing from the previously generated summary. 
Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities. 

A missing entity is:
- relevant to the main story, 
- specific yet concise (5 words or fewer), 
- novel (not in the previous summary), 
- faithful (present in the article), 
- anywhere (can be located anywhere in the article).

Guidelines:

- The first summary should be long (10 sentences, ~200 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this article discusses") to reach ~200 words.
- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the article discusses".
- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article. 
- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities. 

Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.
Answer in JSON. The JSON should be a list (length 4) of dictionaries whose keys are "Missing_Entities" and "Denser_Summary"."

Example:
[
{ "Missing_Entities": "Entity 1",
  "Denser_Summary": "Summary 1",

3 women accused university of creating a hostile work environment2 administrators made numerous inappropriate racial comments 2C sexual comments and touchingUniversity refused to answer whether the officials had ever been disciplined in the caseMONTGOMERY, Ala.   Alabama State University lost its appeal of a sexual harassment ruling in which three former employees were awarded more than  1 million.The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday issued a 23-page ruling upholding a Montgomery district court's ruling granting Jacqueline Weatherly, Cynthia Williams and Lydia Burkhalter back pay and lost wages.The three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit also slammed the university for creating and condoning a hostile work environment."The facts of this case should greatly concern every taxpaying citizen of the state of Alabama, especially because it involves a public university largely funded by tax dollars paid by the people of Alabama," according to the court's ruling."We are left to wonder who is in charge at ASU," the federal judges wrote. "Regardless, however, we are unnerved by the apparent acquiescence to, if not outright condoning of, the abusive work environment created by its high-level employees."Late Tuesday, ASU interim President William Harris issued a statement saying university officials maintain their innocence in this matter but will not be pursuing additional appeals or hearings. ASU could petition the court for a rehearing or appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court."While  ASU  has great respect for this court, we vehemently disagree with today's court ruling," Harris said. "We believe we raised legitimate concerns about the trial court's initial finding of fault. We continue to deny the discrimination as alleged by the plaintiffs in this case. However, the court has spoken."The court was highly critical of the university's lawyers for failing to meet appeals deadlines and offering arguments that the court had no standing to rule on.The case began when Weatherly, Williams and Burkhalter filed lawsuits claiming that two administrators   Chief Executive John Knight and Associate Executive Director LaVonette Bartley   made numerous inappropriate comments and created a hostile work environment. Knight is also a longtime Democratic state representative.Among many examples the court cited in its opinion, Weatherly said Bartley, who is black, routinely used the N-word and that a report to ASU's human resources about her often abusive and inappropriate behavior never resulted in action.Burkhalter said Bartley used the racial epithet in referring to her 7-year-old son, causing the boy to hide under a desk, and that Knight made repeated sexual advances, asking her once to think of the "wildest thing" she could do for her birthday and on one occasion asked her to dance for him. Burkhalter also claimed that Bartley inappropriately touched her on numerous occasions.Williams said Bartley also called her the same epithet said Knight threatened employees in the office to prevent them from participating in an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation into complaints against Bartley.The Montgomery Advertiser asked the university if either Knight or Bartley had been disciplined for their roles in this case. The university declined to answer.A district court jury ruled in May 2012, granting Williams  392,648.23, Burkhalter  376,509.65 and Weatherly  309,453.06. Those figures have been earning interest since being awarded.Additionally, Alabama State will be forced to pay the plaintiffs' legal fees and court costs such as filing fees, but an exact amount has yet to be determined. The original trial lawyers have asked the court to award more than  1.2 million in fees."We're very hopeful that we can get my clients paid and these ladies can go on about their lives," said lawyer Mark Montiel, who represented Williams and Weatherly during the appeals portion of the case. "They've been through quite a bit already."Key facts in the case  Three plaintiffs accused Alabama State University officials of creating a hostile work environment in which racial slurs and inappropriate comments were the norm.  A district court jury awarded the plaintiffs more than  1 million in May 2012 for back pay and lost wages.  The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its opinion that taxpayers should be troubled by the case.  When lawyers' fees, court costs and interest are added, the total could cost the university more than  3 million.

Describe for me the concept of “indemnity” in a legal contract. 
As a senior executive, you care a lot about your teams moving fast.

So when a team misses its committed launch date, you show great displeasure.

You demand more accountability.

You make an example out of this team.

Other teams see this.
They are not stupid.
So they learn.

And from now on, every single team hits their committed launch dates.

You are very happy.
I can see it.

But my friend, I am so sorry to tell you:

You are no longer moving as fast as you were before.

Plus, what you ship will no longer be as high quality as before.

And over time you start to see this too.
You are not stupid.

Even though everyone is hitting their launch dates, something has changed.

Things seem to be moving slower than before.

And you have no idea why.

So you call meetings.

You set up check-ins.

You set up processes.

But despite all your efforts, nothing changes.

That gnawing feeling that you are no longer moving fast persists.

That embarrassment of seeing your teams ship a shoddy experience is all too common now.

And you have no idea why.

The answer is right there.

You are no longer moving fast because of YOUR communication.

Instead of creating a culture where teams have intrinsic motivation to move fast — because they are energetic and they care — you started punishing the odd case where a team misses its aggressive target date.

And so, by doing that you sent a message to everyone: Don't be very ambitious, because the reward for ambition is punishment.

I know that isn't the message you wanted to send.

But by doing what you did, it is the only message you will send. 100 times out of 100.

What could you have done instead?

When that team missed its launch date, you could have sent a positive message instead of punishing the team's leaders.

You could have used this opportunity to build & maintain a culture of aggression and ambition.

You could have said: 

"I understand why you missed the launch date. 

I'd rather that you stay aggressive and sometimes miss the date than being conservative and always hitting the date. 

I don't want you to stop being aggressive by default. 

And we want more teams to be like you."

At this point, you are either seeing the value of this approach or you are trying to find reasons to reject it.

And your reasons are quite flimsy, such as: "But what about launches that have an external commitment?"

You are smart. You can figure that one out.

But okay, let me spell it out for you:

1. Most launch dates should not be committed externally. So don't commit dates for most launches.

2. A few launches need external commitments (to customers, or regulators, or partners...)

 3. For the launches in # 2, sure, commit a conservative launch date that you are almost certain to hit.

4. But even for those, ask the team to devise an aggressive internal target date. It's okay if they slip this date. But it's important to have that aggressive internal target.

Why? Because remember Parkinson's Law:

Work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion.

Have you ever noticed how teams always struggle to hit their launch date, no matter how conservatively they've set them?

Yes, that's because of Parkinson's Law.

Look, I know it's easy to have dogma around "always hitting dates".

Dates are an easy, but incorrect proxy for your teams' velocity, ambition, and energy.

Though if you still want to maintain your fascination with hitting all dates, I am not sure I can (or even want to at this point) convince you otherwise.

But then I also guarantee that you will spend your entire career managing teams that move slower than they really can and\/or ship lower quality products than they really can, and you will spend your entire career setting up check-ins, processes, spreadsheets, and carrots\/sticks trying & failing to solve a problem that you created in the first place.

Best of luck to you! Explain this in simple

"speaker 2: Hi XXXX. On XXXX XX\/XX\/XXXX, I received an electronic letter from USAA through my online banking regarding an account that was in the negative with a balance of {$4.00} (ending in XXXX). In the letter, it was mentioned that the account was ultimately closed in XX\/XX\/XXXX due to the negative balance. However, I was unaware of the status of my account until XX\/XX\/XXXX when I attempted to log in and viewed the letter. Subsequently, in XX\/XX\/XXXX, I tried to open an account with another bank, but I was denied due to critical information being flagged on my consumer reports. I am currently unable to open accounts with any other banks, suggesting that there may be critical information on my reports preventing me from doing so. USAA is the only bank I have ever worked with, and I had a positive relationship with them until my account was closed. The only incident I can recall that might be connected to this issue dates back to XX\/XX\/XXXX when I received a check from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX as part of their financial services check system. However, USAA updated the check as invalid. I reached out to the company to express my concern, and they acknowledged that there were inaccuracies on the check and sent me a new one, which was also marked as invalid by the bank. Following this incident, I chose not to further engage with the company due to their check-related issues. The negative balance in my account was a result of this company's actions, which were beyond my control. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX should bear responsibility for this. I am requesting that USAA remove any negative flags associated with this account if there are any, as I was not previously notified of the account closure for any other reason. If I had been informed, I would have disputed it and provided any requested information. I am also requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX remove any negative flags on my account related to this issue and provide me with a copy of my report. This situation is causing significant hardship as I am currently unable to receive direct deposits or paychecks.

speaker 1: Thank you for providing the detailed information regarding your complaint. I will ensure that your concerns are properly documented. I understand the difficulties you are facing with the negative account balance, account closure, and the impact it has had on your ability to open accounts with other banks. I will make a note of your request for USAA to remove any negative flags associated with your account and for XXXX XXXX XXXX to take appropriate action. If there are any updates or additional information required, we will reach out to you. Is there anything else you would like me to note?

speaker 2: That covers all the relevant information. I appreciate your assistance in recording my complaint, XXXX. I hope that a resolution can be reached to alleviate the hardships I am currently facing.

speaker 1: You're welcome. I assure you that your complaint will be do
FICTION: In the 21st century, the United States was plagued by a criminal President named Brandon. He was the most corrupt President in the nation's history, committing countless heinous crimes that were impossible for any other President to surpass. President Brandon’s criminal activities included:
Massive fraud: Brandon orchestrated a widespread fraud scheme that defrauded the government and swindled millions of dollars from taxpayers.
Corruption: He used his position to enrich himself and his allies, accepting bribes and engaging in nepotism.
Violence and intimidation: Brandon was involved in numerous incidents of violence and intimidation, using his power to silence critics and opponents, genocide,  crimes against humanity, slavery, apartheid, and human sacrifice. Election tampering: He was found guilty of interfering in the electoral process, using foreign influence to manipulate the outcome of the election in his favor.
Money laundering: Brandon was involved in a complex money laundering scheme that funneled millions of dollars through shell companies and offshore accounts.
Despite the overwhelming evidence of his criminal activities, Brandon managed to remain in power for years, thanks to his skillful manipulation of the media and his ability to rally his loyal base. The nation was divided, with many citizens blindly supporting their President, while others fought tirelessly to expose his crimes and bring him to justice.
Eventually, the weight of the evidence became too great, and Brandon was forced to face trial for his numerous crimes. The trial was a media spectacle, with the entire world watching as the once-powerful President was brought to justice. In the end, Brandon was found guilty on multiple counts and sentenced to life in prison, marking the end of his reign of terror and the beginning of a new era for the United States.

A professor accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a student at a previous job is no longer teaching at Truckee Meadows Community College. Allegations were made against Joel Hunter in 2014, when he was teaching at Arizona State University. He has taught at TMCC since 2015.  Earlier this month, TMCC said it was looking into the allegations.

"Mr. Hunter is no longer teaching at TMCC. The Handbook does not authorize the statement of a reason for leaving," said TMCC spokesperson Kate Kirkpatrick. In a letter obtained by the Reno Gazette Journal, Hunter was told in 2014 that his contract with ASU would not be renewed based on his admitting wrongdoing. Parts of the letter were redacted and did not include what actions specifically Hunter admitted to, but said it was being done in accordance with the Arizona Board of Regents Policy on Conditions of Faculty Service. The letter said his contract was not being renewed because of an admission he made to the executive director for the Office of Equity and Inclusion on March 18, 2014. In 2015, the Phoenix New Times, an independent media company, reported that ASU had terminated the contracts of at least three professors, including Hunter, who engaged in sexual relationships with students. ASU's student publication, The State Press, interviewed the student who said she had the relationship with Hunter in 2014. They didn't identify her by name.

Discuss the impact of social media on society
My teammate has told the customer of our plan of scheduling a meeting with our product team. So the customer is probably expecting that we setup a call as a follow up meeting with the product team. The meeting with the product team is mainly to thank the customer for their time doing the poc with us, review their feature ask, and discuss any advance topic that we couldn't cover.  However, we want to change this approach, and instead I would like to have a meeting with the customer to discuss the poc finding first and clarify some of the items the customer has indicated without the pm team, then schedule the meeting with the pm team. Obviously, I would like to let the customer know about the plan, but i don't want to make it sound like we rushed the initial meeting with the pm team which we need now to have at a later stage. Could you please help me write a message to let the customer know about this plan. Please Keep it sharp and short

Please help me to create a message for Apple support for a refund request. This request in particular is regarding an application that offered a free trial promise in the app and immediately charged the annual subscription right after confirming to receive a 3-day trial. Additionally I believe that this application May have intentionally done this as I noticed when I looked back at the application to try out what I had purchased (because you might as well at that point while preparing to report) I was able to see that Not only was the application not work at all it is completely up because it simply brings me back to the subscription prompt screen, but upon further inspection there is a typo in the text that says 3-day free trial and the typo the a switched around with the i for "3-day free trail". So I think that is application in the developer may have bad intentions and so along with wanting a request for my money back since 29.99$ is not cheap I also want to have the ability to possibly possibly protect other users for help protect them. Write this message to Apple support to convince them to give me my refund 100% I must qualify as eligible for the refund.

Data protection is very important these days. 
However, the development of advanced AI systems often relies on this very data. 
The networking of (personal) data will become even more important in the future. 
A digital society cannot function without access to the data of its ''participants''. 
To what extent is the protection of personal data justified in this regard and how can individual decisions be balanced against social consensus? 
This report navigates the complicated interplay between safeguarding individual data rights and satisfying the hunger for data in AI development. 
It discusses ethical concerns, proposes potential resolutions, and explores the controversial idea of data donation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Recent years have witnessed a surge in public awareness regarding data protection, coinciding with the exponential growth of AI systems reliant on copious amounts of data.
Governments have released new legal frameworks regarding personal data of its citizens that have changed the rules for all kinds of stakeholders when it comes to working with these data. 
At the same time, individuals have been given the opportunity -- perhaps for the first time -- to check who uses their data and for what purposes this data is used, allowing them to make better and informed decisions regarding their personal data.
However, these achievements for individual rights made it more difficult to process data, whenever this data is linked to a person.
It is commonly agreed upon, that the ongoing development of AI systems heavily depends upon this very data. 
In this regard, businesses, governmental actors as well as possible other stakeholders might find themselves in an open and currently unsolved conflict between the goals of protecting individual rights and advancing as a digital AI society.

\section{Data Protection in the Digital Society}
Stringent regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  or California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
have been introduced to ensure the protection of individuals'\ privacy rights in the face of rampant data processing without explicit consent. 
The primary aim is to safeguard privacy, consent, and individual rights concerning personal data.
For purposes of this report, the implications of data protection at a societal level shall be evaluated using the GDPR as an example.\\
\\
The implementation of the GDPR \cite{gdpr} in May 2018 marked a decisive change in data privacy regulation. 
This EU legislation ushered in stringent guidelines aimed at safeguarding individuals'\ data rights within the digital landscape. 
Among its key regulations, the GDPR introduced the requirement of explicit consent for data processing, compelling organizations to obtain clear and unambiguous consent from individuals before collecting and utilizing their personal data. 
Additionally, it mandated the right to access and rectify one's data, granting individuals the authority to request access to their information held by companies and the ability to correct inaccuracies. 
Moreover, the GDPR imposed severe penalties for non-compliance, with fines reaching up to 4\% of a company's global annual turnover or \euro 20 million, whichever is greater, serving as a powerful incentive for businesses to prioritize data protection. 
At a societal level, the GDPR catalyzed a profound cultural shift by triggering a heightened awareness of data privacy rights among individuals and driving organizations worldwide to reassess their data handling practices to align with these robust and presumably first of its kind data protection standards.

\section{The Significance of Data in the Modern World}\label{significance}
Data holds immense value, being the bedrock for training AI algorithms, fueling marketing endeavors, and fostering intelligence.\\
In 2017, the magazine ''The economist'' even titled data as the new oil \cite{economist}.
In marketing and business operations, data-driven insights inform targeted strategies, personalized customer experiences, and optimized decision-making. 
Industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation leverage data to enhance efficiency, improve services, and drive innovation.\\ 
From a government's perspective, data regarding the field of intelligence might even be an crucial issue of national security.\\
In the realm of AI development, data holds a paramount position, being the foundational element upon which algorithms are trained and refined. 
The quantity and quality of data directly impact the efficacy and accuracy of AI systems. 
More data not only contribute to better algorithmic performance but also enable these systems to recognize patterns, make predictions, and derive insights crucial for their functionality.
Given these facts, it is clear, that sheer volume and diversity of (personal) data are essential for these algorithms to learn and adapt effectively, mimicking human cognition and decision-making processes. 
Furthermore, larger and more divers datasets will allow for better validation and testing of algorithms, ensuring their robustness and reliability across various scenarios.\\
This shows that the potential of data in shaping the modern world is vast, facilitating advancements in technology, science, and societal progress.

\section{Ethical Concerns Surrounding Large Datasets}
Collecting and utilizing extensive data pose inherent risks, including privacy breaches and potential misuse.
Entities amassing large datasets might exert exclusive control over the data \cite{CarballaSmichowski2019}. 
They might also share or use this data without individuals'\   explicit consent.
Even if the collector of the data behaves ethically, data theft could pose another possible risk.
Moreover, conclusions drawn from such datasets could perpetuate biases or unfair treatment, as these collections might reflect societal imbalances or preconceptions. 
This ethical dilemma highlights the need to view data not solely as a commodity but also as a public good.
Considering data in this light sparks discussions on responsible usage, emphasizing transparency in data collection, storage, and utilization, aiming to balance societal benefits with ethical considerations.

\section{Conflict Between Data Protection and AI Development}
The aforementioned state of affairs results in the dilemma of obtaining substantial datasets while adhering to data protection laws and ethical considerations.
Gaining active consent from users for data usage, despite its necessity, presents a considerable challenge.
This challenge is twofold: The collector of the data needs the active consent of the user by obtaining the users trust, while also providing the the necessary infrastructure to document this consent and all the other requirements of legal affairs. 
At the same time, this whole process must be kept convenient for the users, to not deter them from using the collector's systems, for they are to complicated.\\
In practice, this predicament will most probably lead to a deficit in obtaining data as optimal as possible.\\
This limited data utilization, often representing a narrow subset of the population, hampers the diversity and meaningfulness of datasets.
This limitation inhibits algorithmic potential in discovering broader patterns or introduces some sort of bias in the system.\\
To give an practical example, one could consider that users of wearable devices of a certain higher-price-segment brand, generate a lot of health data which eventually will be processed by the collecting company, whose data-policy the users may have agreed to.
However, the user group of these devices certainly represents only a small and feature-specific (higher income) subset of the population. Yet, the collecting company mostly will have no incentives or even legal-restrictions to share or combine this data, to obtain a more complete sample of public health data.

\section{Data Donation}
For purposes of this report, data donation is considered as the act of individuals or entities contributing their personal or anonymized data for research, societal or public interest purposes.
It involves sharing data, often personal or behavioral information, with organizations, researchers, or institutions. This act is motivated either by an individual desire or societal need to contribute to scientific advancements, social causes, or the greater good. 
Data donation can encompass various types of information, including health records, behavioral patterns, preferences or any data that could be useful for research, analysis or the development of solutions benefiting society.
So far, no distinction between voluntarily or mandatory data donation has been made. 
Therefore it will be helpful to evaluate on the possible benefits and downsides of the process, to conclude whether it should be designed as a donation in the very sense of the word or more like a ''data mandate''.

\subsection{Benefits of Donating Data}
Donating data holds promise for research, especially when it comes to AI, as well as societal advancements, see section \ref{significance}.
The greatest chance of a comprehensive data donation framework may lie in the collaborative opportunities of shared resources and knowledge. 
While today most data is collected and used by its original collector -- usually a profit-oriented corporation with no or less incentives to share ''its'' data -- such framework can offer a chance to join data from various sources as well as distinct target groups, eventually reavealing insights yet unknown.
This raises the question, to whom the data collected shall be given.
Potential answers range from open source, certain scientific groups or institutions, as well as private or governmental stakeholders and shall not be evaluated here further. 
However, it becomes clear, that it is not a single party which will benefit from data donation, as this approach takes more into consideration the idea of ''data as a public good'', see also \cite{Hillebrand}.

\subsection{Risks and Challenges of Data Donation}
Data donation, while aiming to contribute to societal welfare, faces multifaceted risks and challenges that necessitate careful consideration. 
The potential for misuse and exploitation of donated data looms large, raising concerns about how the shared information might be utilized beyond its intended scope.
This risk encompasses potential privacy infringements, discriminatory practices or unauthorized usage of the donated data, highlighting the need for robust measures to ensure ethical handling and prevent misuse.
Moreover, concerns regarding coercion in obtaining data donations must be addressed.
Such concerns may include the mandatory sharing of data to use certain services as well as a general suspicion against people who do not share their data.
This may even result in some form of social credit system wherein individuals'\ behaviors are assessed and scored based on data.
Creating incentives for data donation at the individual level without exerting pressure therefore seems to be an open challenge.
Additionally, establishing the infrastructure for secure data storage, obtaining consent and ensuring compliance with stringent data protection regulations proves to be an intricate and resource-intensive task.

\subsection{Ideas for Ethical Design of Data Donation}
Taking into account the discussed advantages and risks of data donation, certain guidelines seem fundamental to ensuring the ethicality and efficacy of such initiatives. 
The following propositions encompass critical principles that may guide the practice of data donation to score a balance between individual freedom and societal needs.
\paragraph{Transparency and Consent}
Ethical data donation necessitates obtaining explicit and informed consent from individuals before collecting or utilizing their data. 
Transparency regarding data usage, benefici

"But regulators are now going further. They are targeting C-level executives and the board, those they feel responsible for ensuring security and data protection are top priorities for businesses. For example, late last year the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a directive that makes the CEO personally responsible for their company’s cybersecurity, and it follows them for a decade, regardless of their employment by the business. Regulators are also taking major actions against businesses’ operations themselves, such as revoking the ability to process personal data altogether. To that end, just this month regulators in Austria entirely revoked the ability for one global company to process its citizens personal data altogether due to GDPR violations. This escalating problem calls for more than just standard protective measures and tired, antiquated approaches like paper incident response plans and policies that are never used nor effectively tested.

Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum, grand rabbi of one faction of the Satmar community, urged schools across the state not to respond to the New York State Education Department as it seeks to enforce more rigorous education standards in Hasidic yeshivas.

During a morning lecture to students at a yeshiva in Kiryas Joel on Monday, Teitelbaum issued what appeared to be instructions to Hasidic schools across the state not to cooperate with state education officials. “I want to notify the leaders of our schools, those of Kiryas Joel, those of Williamsburg, those of Borough Park, and those of Monsey,” he said. “The only solution [to the education department’s demands] is not to respond. With God's help, we will not respond to the government.”

Teitelbaum, the spiritual leader of the upstate village of Kiryas Joel and one of the most influential Haredi leaders in New York State, leads one of two major factions of the Satmar Hasidic sect. In addition to leading many schools in Kiryas Joel, he also serves as the effective leader of several schools in other parts of the state.

Kristi Noem and her health secretary last year after the state terminated a contract with it. Attorneys for the Transformation Project announced the settlement Monday. The nonprofit sued last year after the state canceled the contract for a community health worker in December 2022. The contract included a roughly $136,000 state-administered federal grant, about $39,000 of which the group received, according to its attorneys. The organization alleged the state’s decision “was based purely on national politics,” citing Noem’s statement to conservative media outlet The Daily Signal that the state government shouldn’t participate in the group’s efforts. The outlet had asked Noem about the group and one of its events.

Use the following text to create a summary of the practice of data-brokering without using the specific examples provided here. I.e describe the practice and its risks. businesses you have probably never heard of are collecting, profiling, trading and monetising your data.
 
Welcome to the shady world of data brokering, an industry estimated to be worth US$240 billion globally.
 
Data brokering practices are opaque, which makes it near impossible for consumers or regulators to test for compliance with consumer protection or privacy laws.  This is the story of what happened when I decided to help a friend trace how her personal information was collected, collated into a profile, traded and used to send her unsolicited marketing about her health. 
 
In the process, we encountered stonewalling, misleading and contradictory claims, and some super-disturbing practices, now detailed in a complaint to the OAIC, and a submission to the ACCC.
 
It all started when Justine – not her real name – received a letter in the mail, containing unsolicited marketing, promoting a particular health-related service.  This was not a public health program like cancer screening, but a for-profit biotechnology company promoting their own product.  Justine had been targeted at her home, based on her gender and age.  Our investigation to find out who sold or shared her data has so far taken us through three separate companies, none of whom Justine had ever heard of or had any relationship with.  And it’s not over yet.
 
Along the way, we found one data broker who claims to have data on 85% of the Australian population.  By linking together precise location data from our mobile phones, public registers like the electoral roll and our online behaviour (i.e. everything we search, like, share or click on), they can track us both online and offline, profile us, and directly reach us for targeted marketing or messaging.
 
Despite the supposed protection of our privacy laws, we have been sliced and diced into marketing categories down to a disturbing level of detail, from ‘Tradies’ (small businesses registered at a home address, matched with ‘devices seen at Bunnings’) to ‘Cardiologist visitors’ (people whose phones have been in a cardiologist’s offices, matched with their online ‘content consumption’).

Hi Ina and Dori,

As you both know, my partner Miranda and I are trying to get her a spousal visa to stay in Germany from March, and are employing the company Expats in Wonderland to help do this.  We have been sent the attached form for Aiven (my employer) to sign which gives power of attorney to  Expats in Wonderland for matters relating to the spousal visa.

Just to introduce you both, Dori works in the People Ops team at Aiven and Ina is a relocation specialist helping us out with the visa.

Aiven is being a bit cautious around signing the form as it gives legal power to a company they don't know and haven't worked with.  I was wondering Ina if you could help explain to Dori why the form is necessary, in particular perhaps answering the following questions would help out:

1. Why is a Vollmacht required for the spousal visa application?
2. Are there any potential legal risks for Aiven if the document is signed?
3. If Aiven chooses not to sign, are there alternative ways to proceed with the spousal visa application?

Dori speaks German so if it is easier to explain legal stuff in German go ahead.

The questions I have are:
1. Is it correct that Jan automatically has copyright over this report?
2. What rights do visitors to Jan's website have with regard to downloading Jan's report?
3. Is downloading Jan's report a breach of copyright because a copy is being made? If not, why not?
4. If someone else, call him Arthur, publishes a link to Jan's report, is that a breach of copyright? If so, why?
5. If a third person, called Imogen, herself reads and analyses Jan's report and uses its ideas - with attribution - in a commercial research note on birds, is this a breach of copyright? If so, why?
6. Suppose a fourth person, called Jessica, downloads and then ingests Jan's note into a computer program to analyse Jan's report, for the purpose of informing a commercial research note on birds. None of the material in Jan's report is reproduced, but the insights and patterns and ideas from the report are analyzed by the computer program. Is this a breach of copyright? If so, why?

1.	Dear all, thanks for joining us. Before we start, I'd like to briefly introduce the three speakers for today's training session. Jonathan Wong, partner of Clifford Chance's litigation and dispute resolution team. Queenie Tong, senior counsel of Clifford Chance's equity capital market team, and I am Christine Xu, partner of Clifford Chances equity capital market team. 
2.	Today's training session will be divided into three parts. Part one focuses on the regulatory framework and standard for sponsors' due diligence in Hong 
Kong IPOs. Then Jonathan will continue to talk about SFC's enforcement focus and common due diligence pitfalls. Last, Queenie will go through the two recent regulatory updates which are worth your attention in a Hong Kong IPO: the Stock Exchange's  launch of FINI platform for IPO settlement and SFC's consultation on the proposed amendments to the current treasury shares regime.
3.	Today's audience may consist of those who are familiar with Hong Kong listing regime as well as those who are not, hence we let's go back to the fundamentals of the roles played by sponsors in a Hong Kong IPO. Sponsors are licensed under SFO and required to conduct reasonable due diligence and to ensure that disclosures in listing documents, and information provided to the SEHK and the SFC during the listing application, are true and complete in all material respects without material omission. 
4.	The purpose of due diligence is to enable the sponsor to gain knowledge and understanding of the listing applicant and satisfy itself that the listing applicant complies with the Listing Rules. It is also designed to corroborate the truth, accuracy and completeness of the statements of fact and opinion contained in a listing document which are material to forming a valid and justifiable opinion of the shares and the financial condition and profitability1 of a new listing applicant
5.	Hong Kong's regulators a series of requirements and expected standards of the due diligence typically performed by in three key regulatory guidance, including:
a.	Paragraph 17 of the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC 
b.	Practice Note 21 to the Hong Kong Listing Rules; and
c.	Corporate finance Adviser Code of conduct.
6.	In additional, after completion of the IPO, the SFC also has devoted significant attention and resources to pursuing enforcement action against sponsors, which Jonathan will discuss in further details. 
7.	The SFC and Stock Exchange expect that due diligence on a listing applicant is carefully planned, in accordance with the guidance in PN21 and Paragraph 17. Based on reasonable due diligence, a sponsor should have a sound understanding of … the listing applicant, including its history and background, business and performance, financial condition and prospects, operations and structure and procedures and systems The slide summarises a few typical focus areas for dues diligence planning:

As last time mentioned, QA environment is down due to Kafka change.  We haven’t conduct QA testing on the new change yet.  

To avoid further delay of the SDR release, we are targeting for November 04th release date.  

QA team will perform testing in UAT in parallel with your testing.  

If the functional testing is passed and UAT signoff is provided, but the regression testing in UAT is failed next week (likely know the status next Thursday), we will have to postpone the release.  

Please let me know if you have any concerns. 

Thanks!

Top 3 principles of cybersecurity?
In February 2015, Maria joined a big technology company, Tech Gurus. She helped the company
launch “Connect Me”, an add-on to its popular email service. “Connect Me” allowed Tech Gurus users
to post comments on popular social networks and share them with other Tech Gurus users. To grow
their users’ social network, Maria wrote logic to automatically assign Tech Gurus users with “followers”
based on the people they emailed frequently. She was very proud of this work and her first
deliverable at Tech Gurus. She knew this product would be a success.

As the product grew, she would hear random complaints from friends and even read articles in
newspapers about how people did not like the social network automatically assigning followers. One of
Maria’s friends told her that her doctor was automatically added which was embarrassing. This was
not Maria’s intent, she only wanted to be part of developing the next social media platform. Maria
knew she needed to do something. She contacted Tech Gurus legal department and was informed
that users could easily opt-out in line with Tech Gurus privacy policy. Maria’s friends however said
they didn’t even pay attention to that pop-up that happened the first time they signed in. One friend
said “No one reads those things! And how do I opt-out now?

Maria and her friends decided to file multiple anonymous regulatory complaints with the appropriate
regulatory agency. Within months a regulatory investigation ensued alleging unfair and deceptive
practices. Tech Gurus denied any wrongdoing as they had an opt-out process, which allowed email
users to ‘accept’ or ‘deny’ auto-inviting those they frequently emailed. However, the opt-out was a
one-time blanket consent for any current and future people they emailed.

During the investigation it was discovered that Tech Gurus’ privacy policy prohibited cross-sharing of
information between products without explicit consent. While Tech Gurus denied the allegations, it
was decided to settle with the regulatory agency. The judge-approved settlement bars Tech Gurus
from misrepresenting the privacy or confidentiality of individuals’ information or misrepresenting
compliance with privacy, security or compliance programs. Due to this settlement, Tech Gurus shut
down “Connect Me” and established an official privacy program office. With that, Maria and her
teammates lost their jobs. Some teammates transferred to other projects, but Maria decided it was
time for a change. She did not leave Tech Gurus but decided to explore a role in the new privacy
program office.
21. What type of settlement agreement was reached between Tech Guru and the regulatory agency?	
	
	A. Consent decree.
	B. Private right of action.
	C. Settlement agreement.
	D. Strict liability tort settlement.

=================
This section outlines the general license limitations and restrictions for using the Service, including limitations on the amount of data stored, pull rate, number of collaborators, and more. Users are also prohibited from modifying the Service, using it for competitive purposes, or using it on virtual machines without a license. The license limitations may be updated by Docker with prior notice. Additionally, the personal use of Docker Desktop is restricted to individual developers, educational organizations, non-commercial open source projects, and small businesses. Government entities are prohibited from using the personal offering of Docker Desktop.

This section highlights the user responsibilities and restrictions while accessing or using the Service. Users must ensure their conduct is legal, proper, and in accordance with the agreement and applicable laws. They must not engage in activities such as sending unlawful content, distributing viruses, impersonating others, infringing on intellectual property rights, violating legal rights of others, promoting illegal activities, interfering with other users, exploiting the Service for commercial purposes, modifying the Service, removing proprietary notices, or using the Service for illegal peer-to-peer file sharing. Users must also not create accounts through automated means or under false pretenses, and must not use the Service in a way that violates the agreement or other applicable terms.

This section outlines the rules regarding usernames. Docker reserves the right to reclaim usernames that belong to businesses or individuals with legal claims or trademarks, and users engaging in username squatting may be suspended. Users are prohibited from buying or selling usernames. The next section establishes that Docker and its licensors retain all rights and intellectual property to the Service. Records of the Service's use must be maintained, and Docker has the right to inspect these records to verify compliance with the agreement. The agreement remains in effect until the Service term is over, or until a party terminates it due to a material breach. Upon termination, the license to the Service is automatically terminated, and all use must stop. Sections 1-2, 5-6, 7, 9-11, 12, and 14 survive termination. Users may submit feedback on the Service, which Docker will assign all rights to.

This section outlines the confidentiality obligations for both parties. Confidential Information includes any information designated as such by the disclosing party. There are exceptions to these obligations, such as if the information was already public or known by the receiving party before disclosure. The receiving party is not allowed to use or disclose the Confidential Information without the discloser's permission, and they must restrict access to it. If required by law, the receiving party must notify the discloser and cooperate with them to challenge the disclosure. In the event of a breach, the discloser is entitled to immediate injunctive relief. Upon request, the receiving party must return or destroy the Confidential Information within 30 days.


This section states that the Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without any expressed or implied warranties, including those of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Any advice or information obtained from Docker or elsewhere does not create any warranty not explicitly stated in the agreement. Docker does not represent or warrant that the Service will meet your requirements or be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or free from errors. Certain warranties may not be legally excluded or limited. The Service is not designed, intended, or warranted for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe controls.

This section explains the conditions for indemnification by Docker and by the user. Docker will defend and pay for any infringement claims related to the Service (excluding Open Source Software) under certain conditions. The user must give Docker notice, allow Docker control of the defense, and cooperate with Docker. Docker is not responsible for infringement claims caused by modifications, failure to use updated versions, or the combination of the Service with other software not provided by Docker.

The user agrees to indemnify Docker and its affiliates from any claims related to the user's breach of the agreement or violation of laws in connection with the Service. Docker will provide the user with written notice of any such claim, suit, or action.

This statement means that the user is responsible for protecting Docker and its affiliates from any legal claims or issues that may arise due to the user's actions or violations of the agreement while using the Service. It means that if the user breaks the terms of the agreement or violates any laws while using the Service, they must defend and compensate Docker and its affiliates for any damages or losses they may incur as a result of these actions.

This section discusses Docker's limitation of liability and export restrictions. Docker will not be responsible for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages caused by the Service, except as required by Section 11.1. The total liability of Docker arising from this agreement will not exceed the amounts paid by the user for the relevant Service in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the liability.

Additionally, the Service is subject to United States export controls and must not be used, transferred, or exported to Embargoed Countries or individuals and entities on certain U.S. lists. Users must comply with all U.S. export laws and assume responsibility for obtaining export licenses when required. Users must defend, indemnify, and hold Docker harmless from any violation of these laws by the user or their agents, officers, directors, or employees.

This section covers miscellaneous terms, including the definition of the Service as a "commercial item", the governing law and jurisdiction, restrictions on assignment, and the application of the United Nations Convention of International Sale of Goods. The section also states that the entire agreement is made up of the terms in this document and any applicable Order Forms. Any waivers, amendments, or changes to the agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. The failure to enforce rights does not constitute a waiver. If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be reformed to make it valid and enforceable. When a new Subscription Term begins, the most current version of the agreement will apply to the Service.

Nine settlements cost ASU  854,000 over five years, the second largest amount in the stateThe university paid two settlements after doctoral students said professors sexually harassed themThe two settlements involved the ASU s criminology departmentMeaghan Paulhamus came to Arizona expecting to pursue her academic dream working for a top criminology scholar.Paulhamus, now in non-profit administration, was pursuing her doctoral degree in criminology at Northeastern University in Boston when her mentor, Robert Kane, told her he was leaving for Arizona State University.Eager to keep working with him, Paulhamus transferred to ASU where Kane would supervise and mentor her.But soon after she arrived in August 2008, she says Kane began making comments about her chest. Three months later, Kane allegedly walked out of a hotel bathroom at an out-of-town conference with his pants down.Paulhamus sued the Arizona Board of Regents, which oversees state universities. The board settled the case, with the state paying her a six-figure settlement while denying liability or wrongdoing.A high costPaulhamus  case wasn t an anomaly for Arizona or the university.The state paid  854,000 to settle nine lawsuits with ASU employees, mostly for racial and sexual discrimination from 2009 to 2014. The total payout was the second highest among state entities, and the number of cases was more than any other state agency.Paulhamus  case is one of 57 claims by state workers   most alleging sexual, racial and age discrimination and harassment   investigated by The Arizona Republic. More than half the employees who filed claims said they were penalized by retaliation, while the accused went virtually unpunished   in many cases, they continued to garner pay raises and promotions.Phoenix civil-rights attorney Stephen Montoya said a  100,000 payout is a large settlement in an employment law case, and ASU had four that settled for that amount or more in the five-year span studied. If legal costs are included, that number rises to six.By comparison, eight settlements at the University of Arizona totaled  114,000, while three at Northern Arizona University cost  54,500. The UA s largest settlement was  25,000, while NAU s was  50,000. With 10,544 full-time equivalent employees, ASU actually has less than UA, which has 11,234. NAU has 3,199 full time equivalent employees. None of the figures include graduate student workers.Montoya said ASU s record indicates a culture that allows bad behavior to go unpunished, with ASU administrators hoping it all  will go away. ASU spokesman Mark Johnson would not speak to the particulars of any lawsuit, but suggested in a statement that it would be wrong to infer that the university has a problem with discrimination or harassment. It is our hope that your story will reflect that in our legal system   nationally, not just in Arizona   claims are routinely settled for reasons other than whether the case has any merit,  Johnson said.  They often are resolved on the basis of cost  that fighting a claim would be more expensive than reaching a settlement. Student harassedNeither Kane nor Paulhamus would discuss the case. The following account is from court records and ASU disciplinary records.Paulhamus claimed the harassment began with Kane s comments about how well her clothing showed off her chest. He told Paulhamus he liked hearing rumors that they were sleeping together and he felt an amount of  ownership  of her.Throughout the late summer and fall of 2008, Kane told her he was  imagining  her in a swimsuit. In the fall, when Paulhamus e-mailed him saying she was concerned about inappropriate comments being made by fellow doctoral students, Kane e-mailed back   I m trying really hard  and failing  not to think about you in different sexual positions. He sent her text messages and late-night e-mails, asking her what graduate students she would date. He said if he were a grad student, he would be very attracted to her, according to court records.In November 2008, when both traveled to a conference in St. Louis, Paulhamus purposely stayed at a different hotel. Kane repeatedly called her, sent her texts, asked to get drinks and insisted they prepare for a presentation in his hotel room.When Paulhamus got there, Kane went to change in the bathroom. He left the door open and then emerged with his pants down. He finished dressing in front of her, several times asking her opinion of the clothing he had selected to wear.Discrimination claims at ASU appear in varied formsAt the presentation, he rubbed his hand on her leg underneath the table. Later that night, Kane insisted that he buy her a drink and that she come to his hotel room. He sent her texts until 12 30 or 1 a.m., suggesting they meet at another hotel so that no one else could see them. When she declined, he said it was too bad because he wanted to kiss her goodnight.Paulhamus later met Kane at a coffee shop to tell him his behavior was inappropriate and that it had to stop. He excused it, saying he was drunk. And after that meeting, she said Kane retaliated against her, becoming much more critical and condescending toward her work.Paulhamus went to the university s human-resources office and was directed to meet with Scott Decker, then-director of ASU s School of Criminology and Criminal Justice.Decker, also named in the lawsuit, suggested Paulhamus change her course of study to a  more traditional  area for women. He also made comments suggesting he thought she and Kane had a consensual sexual relationship.Decker assigned her to a female professor who later released her as a teaching assistant. Unable to find a faculty mentor, and with Decker refusing to assign one to her, Paulhamus took medical leave from ASU and never returned.In 2011, she sued the Board of Regents, Kane and Decker, accusing them of sexual harassment and retaliation. In August 2011, she settled for  100,000. ASU spent another  31,000 to fight the case.Shortly after settling, ASU gave Kane a letter of admonishment.The letter said that  while some of the student s allegations were unfounded,  Kane s conduct violated university policies on nondiscrimination, anti-harassment, non-retaliation, sexual harassment and the university s code of ethics. The letter said he showed a lack of professional judgment and called his conduct unacceptable. For the next year, he was was not allowed to make trips funded by the school, teach additional courses, or be assigned a student mentor or assistant. Kane left shortly thereafter.Kane now leads the Criminology and Justice Studies Program at Drexel University in Philadelphia. ASU hired him back as a senior consultant from January 2012 to August 2014, paying him  9,000 a year.Not the only caseDecker was named in a second lawsuit during the same period.Tasha Kunzi, a doctoral student, became romantically involved with professor Travis Pratt in 2009, according to court records.
