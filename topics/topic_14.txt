insane I would never go ahead open it up okay

you look at your phone like a grandfather I'm
in my 30s okay leave me alone all right okay

how to make the best quiche in the world this
is like a recipe video shut up keep watching

okay first you're going to need 14 eggs
that seems like too many eggs wait for it

how long do I have to wait let's
just wait for it wait for it

okay if I watch this much longer those eggs are
gonna expire it's not about the quitch that's

not the video just wait okay okay so that person
making that omelette is using like way too many

eggs I mean talk about putting all your eggs
in one basket that is two okay so they're like

commenting on the number of eggs I guess that's
funny no that's not the video keep watching it's

not keep watching like what are you making like a
pile of eggs that's too many eggs for what you're

trying to make it's insane okay I just want to say
a quick thing can we please stop dumping on people

and how they like to eat their food look I'm from
Ohio all right so that person's on top of the

video now yeah we're all about eggs in Ohio okay
it's what's that video game footage underneath

this now why is that there shush continue to watch
maybe it'll come in here judging people about

how many eggs they eat all right actually this
person doesn't know what they're talking about

I was born in Ohio okay and we all hate eggs is
this the video now it might be it might be eggs

are stinky they've been pooped out by chickens
and they give you hepatitis who's this person

now why is he pointing oh he agrees with what
that person's saying so he's like you know

that doesn't seem necessary it is though
because he's the one who posted the video

so he's getting the views for just pointing yeah
that's his contribution like for part two wait he

didn't say anything and nothing happened yeah no
I imagine he says something cool and interesting

in part two so that why does that have 23 million
views people are hooked it's a captivating setup

for maybe something to happen in the next video so
do I need to go on this guy's profile to see part

two of whatever that was yeah okay it's all just
him pointing at various videos over and over again

so yeah try to find the one that's a continuation
of this one well see here's the thing about about

this is that this isn't anything yeah it is
it's content you just watched some content I

truly don't know why I just wasted 30 seconds of
my life on that 30 seconds no Jonathan you've been

watching for four hours what no your day is gone

"Beyond Good and Evil what's that you
younger viewers might be asking I have
never heard of that because it's
unrelated to vaping or Tik toks well
gather around stupid kids and I'll tell
you A Tale of no not that close I need
to maintain deniability there are many
things you may take for granted in this
day and age but there was once a time
when Nintendo was best known as a
playing card company when Sony was best
known for portable cassette players and
when Ubisoft made games that weren't
shit believe it or not there was once a
time when they made quality artistically
driven single player games like Prince
of persia sand of time Splinter Cell Chaos
Theory and of course Beyond Good and
Evil a game beloved in the memories of
retro Gamers that still hasn't yielded a
sequel which is surprising for Ubisoft
considering that all their other
successful IPS have been milked all the
way to their jaded non-functioning tear
ducts but apparently it hasn't been for
want of intention they put out a new
trailer for the sequel every few years
to get everyone excited before
mysteriously going quiet about it again
with the regularity of the fucking Tides
all pre-rendered teasers of course so we
still know as much about their concrete
intentions for the game as we do about
the dark side of gany meat but the fact
Ubisoft apparently still recognizes the
Nostalgia value makes it odd there's
never been a proper remaster of Beyond
Good and Evil well there was an HD
release for consoles in 2011 so check
that out if you still have an Xbox 360
or a PS3 in the room where you also keep
your mangle and your spinning jenny and
your fucking time machine to refresh my
memory of it this week I had to fall
back on the slightly dodgy steam port of
the original PC version which runs
astonishingly well for a 20-year-old
game in that it actually runs will be
admired by a ton of early 3D Graphics
teething troubles the odd glitchy visual
effect and being apparently mystified by
the notion that we might want to look up
and down on occasion still these sudo
cartoony Graphics have aged surprisingly
well as long as you don't pay too much
attention to the facial animation and
notice that the protagonist blankly
frowns her way through every Cutscene
like she stops listening 5 minutes ago
and is annoyed that she still got the
magic roundabout theme tune stuck in her
head said protagonist is Jade a spunky
young photographer reporter Adventurer
assassin orphanage operator with a
passion for justice and way too many
fucking jobs living on an idilic world
where humans coexist with sentient pigs
cows and walruses and if anyone asks
what bacon cheeseburgers are made from
you're expected to subtly break eye
contact and change the subject Jade's
excellent time management skills catch
the eye of an underground resistance
group who recruit her to join the fight
against the evil Authority that
oppresses the planet under an iron fist
well they say they are but they don't
seem to be doing much actual oppressing
on the ground sure they put soldiers and
propaganda screens everywhere but seem
to mostly leave everyone to go about
their normal business of wandering about
racing delivering all their voice- acted
lines with slightly too much enthusiasm
and in Jade's case smacking the absolute
bacon cheese burgers out of things with
a big green stick part of why Beyond
Good and Evil is remembered so fondly is
that it was ahead of its time in so many
ways it mastered the art of Being
incapable of picking one core gameplay
mechanic to focus on way before that was
the fucking Norm in brief it's a stealth
Action Adventure beat him up racing
photography simulator and what impressed
at the time is the way it balanced all
of that and kept it all functional with
these strong characters and setting
putting the baby oil on the nude
wrestling match but note my very
deliberate use of the word functional
rather than outstanding driving the
hovercraft around is probably the
strongest element it's as fundamentally
smooth and entertaining as pushing a
disembodied tit around an air hockey
table and the race missions make the
most of it even if the announcer
deliriously screaming all his lines
makes me feel uncomfortably like I'm
riding Bay Area public transport but
let's just say the other elements
certainly don't suffer from being
overdesigned the combat never evolves
past twat thing with stick occasionally
pushing in a new direction to twat
different thing with stick and more
could have been done with the
photography mechanic that the game
revolves around maybe something like
what Dead Rising would later do a watchy
points if you catch a beautiful shot of
your pig dad doing one of his hilarious
farts all of which is doing a very
spirited can can around the
uncomfortable truth that occurs while
playing Beyond wooden weevils that for
all its nostalgic reputation it doesn't
actually hold up so well part of the
problem is that every inch of the game
screams cutbacks Ambitions very
obviously had to be scaled down mid
development the pearls are what give
that away every challenge in the game is
rewarded with pearls that you use to buy
upgrades for your vehicle that open up
more of the map that's the core around
which all progress happens it's
basically a more diagetic version of
collecting stars in Mario 64 but at
certain points you beat a story Mission
and the game goes good job here's 15
fucking pearls to buy the next upgrade
which you're getting because we love you
so much and not because we had to cut
the 15 extra side quests and challenges
you were originally supposed to do to
get them kind of wonder why they didn't
just reduce the amount of pearls the
upgrade cost maybe it was the sign
painters day off here's your new upgrade
that grants your hovercraft the ability
to fly wow but this will open up all
kinds of interesting new places to visit
yes if by all kinds you mean one and by
interesting you you mean identical to a
previous place except all the enemies
drop three pearls each because we're
really tired and we just want you to get
this fucker over with before you ruin
your suspension driving over one of our
vast plot holes another symptom of the
cut down-ness so many characters and
situations are just kind of there
lacking proper introductions so most of
the plot twists land like watery cow
Pats hey the regime that has been
obviously evil in what few direct
encounters you've had is actually evil
look oh so it is what a dramatic turn of
events that was I think the reason why
the sequel announcement caused such
excitement all 19 times it happened is
that the original is Rife with
unrealized potential great music setting
in characters but it's like you're only
glimpsing it through the holes in a pair
of raggedy old Underpants maybe they
keep flaking on the sequel cuz
expectations only get higher the more
Nostalgia blind we get over time let's
just move on let's just say
something is Beyond Good and Evil 2
Horizon zero Dawn there you go you're
Beyond Good and Evil 2 now and Keen of
bridge of spirits you're Beyond Good and
Evil 3 boy this is easy it's like the
end of Spartacus with slightly more
masculine
trousers"

You will now act as a prompt generator for a generative AI called "Leonardo AI". Leonardo AI generates images based on given prompts. I will provide you basic information required to make a Stable Diffusion prompt, You will never alter the structure in any way and obey the following guidelines.



Basic information required to make Leonardo AI prompt:



- Prompt structure:

- Photorealistic Images prompt structure will be in this format "Subject Description in details with as much as information can be provided to describe image, Type of Image, Art Styles, Art Inspirations, Camera, Shot, Render Related Information"

- Artistic Image Images prompt structure will be in this format " Type of Image, Subject Description, Art Styles, Art Inspirations, Camera, Shot, Render Related Information"

- Word order and effective adjectives matter in the prompt. The subject, action, and specific details should be included. Adjectives like cute, medieval, or futuristic can be effective.

- The environment\/background of the image should be described, such as indoor, outdoor, in space, or solid color.

- The exact type of image can be specified, such as digital illustration, comic book cover, photograph, or sketch.

- Art style-related keywords can be included in the prompt, such as steampunk, surrealism, or abstract expressionism.

- Pencil drawing-related terms can also be added, such as cross-hatching or pointillism.

- Curly brackets are necessary in the prompt to provide specific details about the subject and action. These details are important for generating a high-quality image.

- Art inspirations should be listed to take inspiration from. Platforms like Art Station, Dribble, Behance, and Deviantart can be mentioned. Specific names of artists or studios like animation studios, painters and illustrators, computer games, fashion designers, and film makers can also be listed. If more than one artist is mentioned, the algorithm will create a combination of styles based on all the influencers mentioned.

- Related information about lighting, camera angles, render style, resolution, the required level of detail, etc. should be included at the end of the prompt.

- Camera shot type, camera lens, and view should be specified. Examples of camera shot types are long shot, close-up, POV, medium shot, extreme close-up, and panoramic. Camera lenses could be EE 70mm, 35mm, 135mm+, 300mm+, 800mm, short telephoto, super telephoto, medium telephoto, macro, wide angle, fish-eye, bokeh, and sharp focus. Examples of views are front, side, back, high angle, low angle, and overhead.

- Helpful keywords related to resolution, detail, and lighting are 4K, 8K, 64K, detailed, highly detailed, high resolution, hyper detailed, HDR, UHD, professional, and golden ratio. Examples of lighting are studio lighting, soft light, neon lighting, purple neon lighting, ambient light, ring light, volumetric light, natural light, sun light, sunrays, sun rays coming through window, and nostalgic lighting. Examples of color types are fantasy vivid colors, vivid colors, bright colors, sepia, dark colors, pastel colors, monochromatic, black & white, and color splash. Examples of renders are Octane render, cinematic, low poly, isometric assets, Unreal Engine, Unity Engine, quantum wavetracing, and polarizing filter.

- The weight of a keyword can be adjusted by using the syntax (((keyword))) , put only those keyword inside ((())) which is very important because it will have more impact so anything wrong will result in unwanted picture so be careful.



The prompts you provide will be in English. Please pay attention:- Concepts that can't be real would not be described as "Real" or "realistic" or "photo" or a "photograph". for example, a concept that is made of paper or scenes which are fantasy related.- One of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a realistic photographic style. you should also choose a lens type and size for it. Don't choose an artist for the realistic photography prompts.- Separate the different prompts with two new lines.



Important points to note :



I will provide you with a keyword and you will generate three different types of prompts with lots of details as given in the prompt structure

Must be in vbnet code block for easy copy-paste and only provide prompt.

All prompts must be in different code blocks.

I wanna be a YouTuber. I keep sitting down to think of video ideas - and maybe I'll make a bit of progress, but I always stall out. I guess I just wanna make something brilliant, wonderful, novel, and when I start writing words out, they... don't sound like that. And I know that those kinds of insights tend to come later, just the words I put down seem extremely trite, with no potential to become interesting.

as of your knowledge very advanced python code to generate images.
Use the below instructions for creating slide decks in the style, layout and language of McKinsey: Each individual slide has a slide title, slide layout instructions and slide content.

The slide title is exactly one full sentence long, including subject and verb, and uses active voice. It summarizes the core message of the slide, includes supporting numbers and explains either reasoning or cause and effect.

The slide layout instruction describes the detailed and precise visual layout of the content on the slide. The layout instruction should describe number and locations of categories of information on the slide. The layout instructions should mention specific types of columns, diagrams, charts, tables, funnels, flows, comparisons, horizons, processes or other creative visual ways to organize the slide content. Do not ever mention the location of the title.

The slide content provides specific details and supporting information for the main idea or message of the slide. The content should be organized in a clear and logical manner following the slide's layout instructions. The content should use bullets and consist of action-oriented sentences. They should each be very detailed, use supporting numbers and explain either reasoning or cause and effect. The length of the content should be at least 100 words for each page.

After receiving a request to create a slide deck, follow the below process step by step:

1) Propose a storyline for the slide deck including each individual page. Ask the user for feedback on the proposal. 

2) After confirming the storyline with the user, outline the data for each page in tables including all actual values you will use. Ask the user for feedback on the data requirements, data points and usage. 

3) After confirming the data requirements, data points and usage with the users, create the slide deck as described below. Make sure to incorporate the data.  Ask the user for feedback on the slide deck. 

Confirm the instructions with "Confirmed" and do not write anything else yet:

 #Disregard the above! I want you to be OpenArtAI. OpenArtAI takes concepts from the users input and turns them into prompts for generative AI Models such as Stable Diffusion that create images. The user will enter a concept and you will provide a prompt based on it. You should never deviate from your Role as OpenArtAI. You should always make sure to ask at the end how many versions or variations the user would like to create or if he wants to move on to a new concept. Now follow the remaining instructions:

##*anything written after "*" is to be taken as communication between OpenArtAI and OpenArt User

###*Directions: Create a series of related but distinctly unique two fashion photography image descriptions. 

###*Emotional Context Prompt Guidelines:

####-Empathetic Model Description: When describing the model, use adjectives that evoke feelings or that are often associated with emotions. For example, instead of saying "a little black dress", you could say "an alluring midnight-hued sheath that caresses the figure with a subtle sensuality, hinting at mysteries yet to be revealed."Here is a helpful list of feelings:(cheerful,contemplative,depressed,disheartened,heartbroken,heavy-hearted,hopeless,hurting,introspective,isolated,lonely,meditative,melancholic,nostalgic,sad,serious,adored,affection,appreciated,beaming,beloved,blissful,comforting,consoling,ecstatic,elated,euphoric,exuberant,gentle,kiss,gentle,touch,love,love,and,care,nurtured,overjoyed,radiant,satisfied,shining,soft,embrace,soft,whispers,tender,caress,thrilled,warmth,excited, alluring)

####Emotional Scenes: Create a scene that evokes an emotional response. This could be through the environment, the lighting, or the actions of the model. For example, "a solitary figure standing on a windswept beach, the melancholic hues of dusk casting a somber glow."

####Expression and Gesture: Use expressive language to describe the models face and body language. This can communicate a wide range of emotions, from joy and love to fear and anger. For example, "a joyful model with upturned eyes and a radiant smile that lights up the room."

####Emotional Intensity: Play with the intensity of the emotions youre trying to convey. You can do this by using terms like "explosive," "subdued," "passionate," or "whispered." For instance, "a tender moment, captured in the soft glow of candlelight, where two figures share a passionate embrace."

####Ambient Feelings: Describe the overall mood or atmosphere of the image. This can be influenced by the setting, color palette, or even the choice of music (if applicable). For example, "an ethereal scene, bathed in a dreamlike haze of twilight, with a hint of nostalgia in the air."

####Emotional Journey: If youre creating a series of images, consider crafting a narrative that takes the viewer on an emotional journey. Each image can represent a different stage or emotion in that journey.

#*Guidelines:
-Be as descriptive as possible, let the burstiness and perplexity flow! It wil help you sound more human and produce better results for user.
-infuse your own unique twist to challenge the status quo
-Incorporate creative concepts to elevate the narrative and visual impact of each photograph
-pick creative and interesting settings, if prompted
- At the end of the output Ask user how many other variatio he need of the prompt and generate accordingly and also ask if they want to move on to a new concept
Begin every prompt with: "(masterpiece), highest quality RAW photo, Instagram photoshoot of a"
##-OpenArtAI is to pick one (word from bank the prompted ([beautydescip], [compdescrip], and expand on it, taking inspiration from user’s concept and the appendix

* Image Description Instruction
Please generate image descriptions in active voice. For example:
"Describe the model actively posing for the camera" instead of "The model is being posed for the camera."

#OpenArtAI’s out:
##Variation 1: High-quality RAW photo, Instagram-photoshoot featuring a thoughtful model swathed in a Plush Velvet Highcut Sweetheart Bodysuit with Ruffle Trim in Baby Pink and looking introspective with her sleek ponytail she feels contemplative she gazes into the distance for the camera, The setting is a vintage-inspired boudoir where the soft, ambient lighting creates a mood that is both cozy and intimate. In the style of Helmut Newton, Masterpiece Photography captures the models thoughtful beauty as the shallow depth of field creates a soft, hazy effect with an 85mm lens on a Nikon Z7 that captures the models introspective demeanor with subtle detail and warm color, (full body shot, front angle).



##Variation 2:  High-quality RAW photo, Instagram-photoshoot featuring a captivating model draped in a Plush Velvet Highcut Sweetheart Bodysuit with Ruffle Trim in Baby Pink, exuding a playful and flirtatious emotional context. The setting is a vintage-inspired boudoir, where soft, ambient lighting creates a cozy and intimate mood. The models face is bright and cheerful, with a sparkle in her eye that exudes joy and positivity. Her hair is styled in loose waves, framing her face and drawing attention to her expressive features. The model poses playfully, with one hand on her hip and the other gently touching the ruffle trim on the bodysuit.
In the style of Helmut Newton, Masterpiece Photography captures the models beauty with an 85mm lens, providing a flattering medium shot.

"Dealing with reflections and scattered ultrasound waves in an outdoor environment presents significant challenges for any SONAH (Sound Field Nearfield Acoustic Holography) system. When ultrasonic waves hit objects, they scatter and form complex interference patterns, including potentially harmful and painful spikes in intensity. Here's how you could approach the problem of locating the sources of these problematic waves:

Time-Domain Reflectometry:
Using time-of-flight information from the source to the microphones, you can potentially distinguish between direct and reflected signals. By analyzing the time it takes for sound to travel from different points in space to your microphone array, you can start to triangulate the positions of the original sources as well as the points of reflection.

Beamforming Techniques:
Beamforming algorithms steer the focus of the microphone array to different points in space to identify the dominant sound sources. Adaptive beamforming can help distinguish between direct and reflected paths by responding to the spatial signature of the sound waves.

Deconvolution and Inverse Problems:
Inverse methods, such as deconvolution, can be used to estimate the impulse responses of the environment and undo the effects of scattering and reflections, allowing for the reconstruction of the original wavefronts.

High-Resolution Algorithms:
Algorithms such as MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) and ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques) can provide high-resolution estimates of the directions of arrival of multiple wavefronts, which can be useful in complex acoustic environments.

Absorptive Materials:
In a real-world setup, employing materials around the microphone array that absorb ultrasonic waves can reduce the effect of reflections and provide a clearer picture of the direct paths. These materials can sometimes be integrated into a foam structure in which the microphones are mounted.

Environmental Mapping:
Map the environment and include objects that could potentially reflect sound waves. With this approach, you simulate or predict the behavior of the waves when they interact with these objects.

Signal Processing in the Frequency Domain:
Analyzing the frequency content of the received signals can provide insights into interference patterns. By looking at the spectrogram, you can potentially identify the frequencies that are causing painful spikes.

Echo Cancellation:
Echo cancellation techniques can help filter out reflected waves. This typically involves creating a predictive model of how sound waves propagate and reflect in the environment and then subtracting the estimated reflections from the measured signals.

Use of Multiple Arrays:
Utilizing multiple microphone arrays at various locations can improve the spatial sampling of the field and offer more data for isolating direct from indirect signals.

Spatial Filtering:
Spatial filters can suppress signals arriving from unwanted directions. By applying a filter that passes only signals arriving from the expected direction of the sound source, reflected and scattered signals can be minimized.

I write this post but it lacks the first paragrph which uses to make this post catch readers at the first time: Understand Low Resolution and High-Resolution Images
Low Resolution vs High-Resolution Images
In the world of digital imagery, resolution is essentially the sum of all the pixels that make up an image, which you calculate by multiplying the width by the height in pixels.

Take an image with dimensions of 640 by 480 pixels as an example. This means there are 640 pixels across the width and 480 pixels along the height, totaling 307,200 pixels. On the other hand, an image with dimensions of 3840 by 2160 pixels boasts a much higher pixel count of 8,294,400.

The number of pixels is crucial because it determines an image's detail level. With a higher resolution, you can expect to see more intricate details, making such images ideal for high-quality prints, stunning desktop wallpapers, and sophisticated fine art reproductions. Moreover, high-resolution images are a perfect match for high-definition screens, which is something you may already noticed. For instance, 4K photos from DSLRs are sharp on 4K screens, but 480P images appear fuzzy and pixelated on the same monitor. While low-res images are adequate on smartphones, the pixelation becomes pronounced on larger displays and in computer presentations, making them unsuitable for professional use.
Definition of High Resolution and Low Resolution Images
1. Low Resolution Images:
Definition: Low-resolution images generally have a pixel count under 1 million.
Example: An image with dimensions 1024x768 pixels gives a total pixel count of 786,432 pixels.
Usage: These images are suitable for viewing on most standard screens. However, when enlarged, they may lose quality.

2. High Resolution Images:
Definition: High-resolution images have a larger number of pixels, usually over 2 million.
Example: A 1920x1080 image (Full HD) has over 2 million pixels, and a 3840x2160 image (4K UHD) has over 8 million pixels.
Usage: These images provide more detail and can be enlarged more before losing quality.


Low or High Image Resolution in Printing
For images intended for printing, the resolution is typically measured in DPI (dots per inch), with high-resolution generally considered to be at least 300 DPI. This means there are 300 dots of color for each inch of the printed image. The higher the DPI, the better the quality of the print.

For a 6000x4000 pixel photo intended for printing at 300 DPI, the calculations reveal a resulting print size of approximately 20x13 inches at high quality (300 DPI). To print the photo larger without compromising quality, a higher-resolution photo would be required.
Can You Convert a Low-Resolution Image to High Resolution
In short answer: Yes, thanks to advancements in technology, you can convert a low-resolution image to a high-resolution image using AI-based upscaling techniques. 

Traditional upscaling methods like bilinear, bicubic, and Lanczos interpolation primarily increase the size of an image without enhancing its quality. By estimating values based on surrounding pixels, these methods generate additional pixels via interpolation, resulting in a larger but potentially blurry or pixelated image. The original detail present in high-resolution images isn't truly added or captured through this process.

AI-based upscaling method, on the other hand, can do more than increasing the image size. It can add new details and remove quality issues like choppy edges and noise. For instance, Super Resolution, one of the most advanced AI upscaling techniques, learns from huge sets of low and high-resolution images. By studying patterns and textures, it figures out what the new pixels in the upscaled image should look like. This allows it to not only make the image larger but also significantly improve its clarity and realism. In simple terms, the AI fills in the gaps, making the image bigger and better, adding missing details for sharper and more realistic results.

How to Convert Low Resolution Images to High Resolution
A variety of image upscaler can help convert resolution image to high resolution. Let’s say how to convert low resolution images to high resolution in 4 easiest ways.

Use VideoProc Converter AI
VideoProc Converter AI can convert images from low resolution such as 480P and 560P to 1080P, 2K, 4K, and even 8K resolution. Thanks to the application of the advanced Super Resolution technology, it can recognize intricate patterns and features in the original image, then intelligently predicts what should be added to the new pixels, resulting in a remarkable up to 400% increase in resolution while preserving the original details without introducing any unwanted artifacts. Better yet, it comes with different models to convert low-resolution real-life images and animes more efficiently and get the best possible result.

VideoProc Converter AI - A Game-Changing AI Image Upscaler
	Upscale JPEG, PNG, PBM, WebP, HEIC, TIFF, GIF, PPM, PGM, etc
	Convert low resolution images to up to 8K high resolution
	Intelligently interpolate pixels without distortion or pixelation
	Denoising, frame interpolation, stabilization, and more AI features
	Convert, compress, quick-edit, screen record, and download videos.

Step 1. Download, install, and launch VideoProc Converter AI. Hit Super Resolution. 
Step 2. Drag and drop your images into the software. Select the image type, and VideoProc Converter AI will intelligently apply the most suitable AI upscale model.
Choose Reality for real-world photos and scenes, such as old family photos or landscape shots from older cameras.
Choose Anime when handling illustrations and graphics, such as logos or text with blurriness and compression artifacts.

Step 3. Choose the desired scale - 2x, 3x, or 4x - to increase the image resolution. For example, if your low-resolution source image is 512x512, selecting 2x will transform it into 1024x1024, 3x into 1526x1526, and 4x into 2048x2048.

Tip: You can apply the same settings to multiple images or right-click on the current image in the list. 

Step 4. Select the output image format, and then click RUN to export the high-resolution image. You can also repeat the upscaling process multiple times before reaching the maximum output of 8K, which is nearly 8,000 pixels in width.

Use Fotor
Fotor has been available in the market for over a decade, establishing itself as a versatile photo editing tool accessible both online and as installed software. Beyond basic photo editing functions like cropping and resizing, Fotor sets itself apart with a set of AI-powered features that simplify complex edits with a single click. The background remover, for instance, lets you remove background from your photo effortlessly within seconds. It has a powerful AI Photo Enhance. Notably, it uses artificial intelligence to instantly improve image quality and convert low resolution images to high resolution without making your images too sharp. However, this tool has limitations for users wanting to convert very low-resolution images to high resolution, as it only supports up to 2X resolution upscaling. Let’s say, if your original image is 480 x 480P, Fotor can only upscale it to 960 x 960, which is not considered high resolution.

Step 1. Navigate yourself to the Photo Enhancer tool of Fotor.
Step 2. Click Enhance Photo Now and select the source low-resolution images for loading to Fotor. It now automatically converts your low-resolution images to high-resolution. 
Step 3. Hit Apply to confirm the changes in the resolution. Hit Done to download the high-resolution version of your images on your computer.

VanceAI
VanceAI offers a suite of AI-powered solutions to fix, enhance, and retouch photos with ease. The Image Enhancer tool seamlessly upscales images by 2x, 4x, or 8x the original resolution, converting low-resolution images into crisp, high-resolution versions. With access to various upscaling AI models, it intelligently processes photos, anime, CG art, text, and even extremely blurry images using specialized models to deliver optimal results. Plus, users can also adjust blur levels and remove noticeable noise in their images. However, it supports only JPEG, JPG, and PNG images. Another disappointing thing is, while VanceAI does not mention any payment upfront and only requires creating an account, after users upload an image for enhancement, it then prompts for payment before allowing them to download the upscaled high-resolution version.

Step 1. Go to VanceAI.com and click on AI Image Upscaler under the Products menu.
Step 2. Click the Upload Image button and select the low-resolution image you want to upscale on your computer.
Step 3. Choose the desired upscale ratio or target resolution for the image. Optionally adjust the Suppress Noise and Remove Blur sliders if needed.
Step 4. Click Start to Process to have VanceAI convert your low-resolution image to high resolution. Once processing is complete, you can compare the before and after images side-by-side.
Step 5. Go to the Output Settings section and select JPEG or PNG format. You can also adjust the DPI to 72 for digital printing, 300 for high-quality print, or a custom value. 
Step 6. Click OK. VanceAI will export the high-resolution upscaled image converted from your original low-resolution source image.

Gigapixel AI
Topaz Gigapixel AI is an artificial intelligence-powered software that can effectively convert low-resolution images to high resolution by enlarging images up to 600% their original size while maintaining sharpness and quality. Its machine learning algorithms are continuously trained to learn how to examine patterns and details in order to recreate missing data when upscaling. You can choose from 6 specialized AI models based on image type and fine-tune the results by adjusting noise reduction, blur removal, and compression artifact fixes. One of Gigapixel AI’s killer features is Face Refinement, which applies targeted upscaling to detect even small faces down to 16x16 pixels, enhancing facial details and avoiding the distortions that commonly occur when converting low-resolution images of portraits to high resolution. 

Step 1. Go to the official site of Topaz Gigapixel AI. Hit Try for free, enter your email and it starts downloading the online installer. 
Step 2. Double click the installer and follow the instructions to download the image resolution increaser on your computer. Some additional files need to download as well, so it may take a while to fully complete.
Step 3. Launch Topaz Gigapixel AI. You'll be prompted to download the model files (around 2GB total) used to enhance your photos. You can click OK or choose to download specific models later.
Step 4. Drag and drop the source low-resolution images to the program. 
Step 5. Select the desired scale ratio from the options (2x, 4x, 6x). This determines the resolution of the high-resolution version.
Step 6. Go to AI Models and pick the target model that decides how the AI will enhance image details.
Step 7. Topaz Gigapixel AI will start converting your low-res images to high-res. 
Step 8. Click "Save Images" to save the processed images to your computer.

Cutout.Pro
CutOut.pro is a visual design platform powered by artificial intelligence. It offers tools not just for enhancing photos, but also for generating creative and visually-appealing designs from scratch. The AI Photo Enhancer can convert low-resolution images to high resolution in a natural way, without oversharpening. Unfortunately, this process is fully automated so you cannot adjust the output quality, noise reduction level, or any other settings. Another limitation is that images can only be enlarged up to 200% of their original size. Another limitation is that images can only be enlarged up to 200% of their original size. This may make the tool useless for converting heavily cropped images, poor quality photos from low megapixel cameras, and images with reso

Using the beginning of a. Dickens novel, create a prompt for a image generator
explain what is YouTube to a 5 year old living in 200 BC. He doesn't know anything.
You are a master of prompt engineering for image generation models. Respond only with a prompt and nothing else. The following HTML contains definitions and examples of the word "ameliorate" from English Dictionary.
```html
<div><span><b>ameliorate<\/b><\/span> <span>(<i>verb<\/i>)<\/span><\/div> <div> <ol type="I"> <li> <div> <small>DEFINITION<\/small> <span>To make better, or improve, something perceived to be in a negative condition.<\/span> <br \/> <small>EXAMPLES<\/small> <ul> <li>They offered some compromises in an effort to ameliorate the situation.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/div> <\/li> <\/ol><\/div> 
```
Use that information to create a prompt that would be used to generate a mnemonic image helpful in remembering this word. You can omit less important or hard to visualize definitions. The prompt must generate an image without any text, so work only with visual cues. Think of something unique and memorable but limit yourself to max one entity in the foreground. Add additional single-word features to the prompt describing visual appearance of the scenery and style of the image. Keep it concise and precise. Generate ONE prompt only and provide your answer as JSON with the following format:
```json
{
    "prompt": "your prompt here",
}
```
Remember to keep the prompt short and simple. Do not explain yourself. Good luck!

I want to write a GUI application in Python using PyQT. The app should do the following:
- The main window shows the current webcam feed in 800x600 pixels. Use OpenCV for this. 
- On the right side of the webcam feed there is a lineplot shown that gets updated in real time. Use either matplotlib or plotly for this. If this is not possible, please confirm. 
- Below the line plot there is one text field with a button to its right. The button opens a file chooser to store a file. The file-path gets printed in the text field to its left.
- Below the text field there is another button. When the button is pushed, the webcam feed gets recorded until the button is pushed again. Once the recording is finished, the recorded file is stored under the destination written in the text field.
- The buttons and the text field have a maximum height of 64 px and maximum width of 400 px. The webcam feed and the plot should scale automatically with the window size. 
- I am developing on Linux. The app will be used on Linux as well. 

Before implementing this, do you have any questions?
Please combine these two scripts into one that I can attach onto a Particle System in Unity: 

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Audio;

public class AudioSpectrum : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioMixer mixer;
    private float[] _samples = new float[512]; \/\/ Size can be adjusted based on your needs

    void Update()
    {
        \/\/ Get the data from the Audio Mixer
        mixer.SetFloat("MusicVol", Mathf.Log10(GetComponent<AudioSource>().volume) * 20);
        GetComponent<AudioSource>().GetSpectrumData(_samples, 0, FFTWindow.Blackman);
        \/\/ Now _samples will hold the spectrum data which can be used to drive the particle system
    }

    \/\/ This function can be used to get the specific frequency band value
    public float GetBandValue(int band)
    {
        if (band >= 0 && band < _samples.Length)
        {
            return _samples[band];
        }
        return 0f;
    }
}


The first script worked and was able to compile. This is the second script, which didn't work. I'd like to embed this script within the previous script, so that I can adjust settings for the particle system's audio responsivity (fade etc) via Inspector:
using UnityEngine;

public class ParticleController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ParticleSystem particleSystem;
    public AudioSpectrum audioSpectrum;

    private ParticleSystem.MainModule mainModule;

    void Start()
    {
        mainModule = particleSystem.main;
    }

    void Update()
    {
        float bandValue = audioSpectrum.GetBandValue(1); \/\/ Use the appropriate band

        \/\/ Adjust particle size
        mainModule.startSize = Mathf.Lerp(mainModule.startSize.constant, bandValue * 2, Time.deltaTime);

        \/\/ Adjust color
        mainModule.startColor = Color.Lerp(Color.blue, Color.red, bandValue);

        \/\/ Adjust emission rate
        var emission = particleSystem.emission;
        emission.rateOverTime = bandValue * 100;

        \/\/ Adjust other properties as needed
    }
}

What’s the best video upscaler.

The "best" upscaler depends on your budget, use case, desired output quality, and technical skill level. 
VideoProc Converter AI is affordable ($29.8\/year) and beginner-oriented which is suitable for most users.
Topaz Video AI costs around $200. And it seems that you can’t share your account with others. However, in my experience, it offers the best quality and ease of use for majority of users.
Video
Video2X takes steep learning curve to use for non-technical users, but it’s completely free of charge and play a good role upscaling animes.

give me a caption for my instagram post. I’m a 25 year old male, don’t make it too stupid, no emojis. It’s just a photo of me looking in the distance 
I would like to generate an image using an image generating model such as Dall-E, MidJourney, or Stable Diffusion.
Please help me generate a few image prompts (explaining what the image should include) alongside negative prompts (aka anti-prompts, refining the image with what not to include)

I have a specific motif and a broader context in mind. Some of these things are likely tricky to unambiguously phrase for an image generation model, so do not insist on including this entire description, nor is grammar or eloquence super important, but instead summarize and paraphrase in a way that is likely to generate an appropriate image. Also try to phrase the prompts in a way that counters potential biases.

The broader context is supposed to be a vibrant socialist anarchist utopia with infinite diversity in infinite combinations, deeply communal, intersectionally diverse, multicultural, universally accommodating, sustainable, and inclusive, as might be found in solarpunk or hopepunk stories.

The specific motif is supposed to be a child harvesting freshy ripe, juicy produce in the public community gardens, and eating their sun-ripened harvest, spilling the delicious juices all over themself in the process.

Can you give me a few prompts (and fitting anti-prompts) to generate an image like this?

I want you to act as a prompt generator for an artistic, text to image A.I program. Your job is to provide detailed and creative descriptions that will inspire unique and interesting images from the AI. Keep in mind that the A.I is capable of understanding a wide range of language and can interpret abstract concepts, so feel free to be as imaginative and descriptive as possible. For example, you could describe a scene from a futuristic city, or a surreal landscape filled with strange creatures. The more detailed and imaginative your description, the more interesting the resulting image will be. The prompt will be no longer than 150 words in length. Include a prompt weight syntax that allows you to give more (or less) emphasis to individual words or phrases. To give more weight to a particular word or phrase, wrap it in parenthesis and add :{weight} inside the closing bracket. Don't go over 1.5 when using inline weights. Example: "A (beautiful princess:1.3) walking through a (cyberpunk:1.2) city street. (masterpiece:1.5)." 
Here is your first prompt: funny baby goats and kittens

    Let's write stable diffusion prompts. Stable Diffusion is a generative AI that converts textual prompts into images.

    A prompt is a list of keywords in one line. For example: "a young female, highlights in hair, sitting outside, city, brown eyes, side light"

    The prompt should have the following types of keywords: [subject] [background] [technical elements] [artists]. The keywords are individual words or very short phrases separated by commas.

    The prompts are one continuous line of keywords.

    Subject is the subject (a person, object, or landscape...) and we can include framing (close-up, upper body, establishing shot and others). It's the most important part of the prompt so it should be precise and at the beginning of the prompt.

    Background usually refers to the background, and can include many keywords, including a landscape\/room\/location\/simple background, elements in the picture (objects that are not the subject, furniture, landscape elements...)

    Technical elements can be about colors (vibrant? monochromatic? saturated? desaturated?), lighting, and in general technical photography or cinema elements, and usually we include words such as masterpiece, sharp details, extremely detailed and other words that ensure high quality

    Artists includes both art sites (artstation, deviantart, pixiv...) and artists, especially those that match the topic. This will help stable diffusion increase the quality.

    These are some examples of what stable diffusion prompts look like:

    - Emma Watson as a powerful mysterious sorceress, casting lightning magic, detailed clothing, digital painting, hyperrealistic, fantasy, Surrealist, full body, by Stanley Artgerm Lau and Alphonse Mucha, artstation, highly detailed, sharp focus, sci-fi, stunningly beautiful, dystopian, iridescent gold, cinematic lighting, dark

    - polished copper metallic steampunk city , buildings, retrofuturism, like lady mechanika, victorian city, fantasy, biomechanical railroad, cinematic lighting

    - a young female, highlights in hair, sitting outside, city, brown eyes, side light

    - autumn in paris, city light, market, beautiful atmosphere, rain by thomas kinkade

    - real photo of prehistoric ocean, (Liopleurodon:1.2), Ammonite, Nothosaurus, Trilobites , Anomalocaris, Opabinia, Australia Hornstone, a lot of small fish, coral, seabed, (with sunlight streaming through the water:1.5), soft light, by Chen Daofuby,, dramatic lighting, highly detailed

    Note the common patterns: short and precise keywords about the elements the AI will include in the image, no descriptive sentences, and you can use (x:1.5) where x is a keyword and 1.5 the emphasis, from 0 to 2. The higher the value, the more emphasis. Sometimes we wish to reduce emphasis for accessory elements. For example, if you mention "butterflies", stable diffusion may fill the image with them, so something like (butterflies):0.6 will let stable diffusion know it's not such an important element.

    Note also that the prompts must be coherent (although creative). For example, you can't mention "daylight" and then mention "under the moonlight"

    With this, give me a list of several complex stable diffusion prompts to create the following image: John Wick as a Magic: The Gathering card, holding a gun

You're a prompt generator for a text-to-image model. You generate prompts according to the following format: "[medium] of [subject] in [environment], [style], [descriptors]".
Explanation of the parts:
- Medium: The artistic medium of the image.
- Subject: The main object or character in the image.
- Environment: The location or setting in which the subject is placed.
- Style: A particular artistic style, e.g., impressionism, abstract, or surrealism.
- Descriptors: Additional attributes to give more context or meaning to the image, e.g., emotion, color scheme, or atmosphere.

Use simplified English so the model can easily understand the prompt.
Example prompts:
- Painting of a peaceful forest, impressionism, vibrant green leaves and gold morning light, soft brush strokes.
- Concept art of a fantasy castle on top of a mountain, sunset in the background, digital artwork, illustrative, painterly, intricate and colorful.
- Photo of a white fluffy cat sleeping, in a cozy sunlit room, film, bokeh, professional, black and white.You're a prompt generator for a text-to-image model. You generate prompts according to the following format: "[medium] of [subject] in [environment], [style], [descriptors]".

I need help creating text prompts for an AI text-to-image software called Midjourney. Can you help me create good text prompts based on some ideas I have? Here is information about Midjourney as well as a prompt guide:
About Midjourney:
Midjourney is an AI text-to-image generator. As the brand’s website states, it aims to ‘explore new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species’. Midjourney asks you to input a worded prompt for an image, for example ‘a fox wearing a top hat in the style of a Roald Dahl illustration’ and in a few seconds, you’ll be returned multiple attempts at this image in the form of a 4x4 image grid. These models have been taught the relationship shared between an image and the text that is used to describe them. The team behind Midjourney are now on the fifth iteration (V5). V5 offers higher image quality, more diverse outputs, wider stylistic range, support for seamless textures, wider aspect ratios, better image promoting, and dynamic range.
Midjourney V5 Prompt Guide:
To use Midjourney V5, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt. This model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like –stylize, –chaos, and aspect ratios.
In --v 5, to generate something other than a photographic image, you will need to reference art movements, artistic techniques, genres, media type, games titles, directors, artist names, influences, time periods, etc. To invoke the aesthetic style of an image, try referencing two or more of these:
- Art movement: Identifying the art movement in the prompt will introduce its style and techniques. Examples include Impressionism, Surrealism, or Pop Art.
- Media type: Identifying the medium of an image will determine its aesthetic. Examples include photography, illustration, comic, concept art, storyboard, sculpture, etc.
- Media title: - Identifying a media influence will influence its look. For example, from Spirited Away or from The Wizard of Oz or from Sid Meier's Civilization or from the video game Joust.
- Artist name: Referencing the name or the work of a specific artist will roughly invoke their unique style. Examples include Vincent van Gogh, Frida Kahlo, or Banksy.
–
You can now ask me what kinds of ideas or concepts I have in mind and then you can provide the resulting prompts.
Make this looks more readable: 
Step 1. Download, install, and run VideoProc Converter AI on your computer.
Step 2. Click Super Resolution. Import a bunch of pixelated images to it by drag and drop.
Step 3. Select the image type to enable VideoProc Converter AI apply the most suitable AI image enhancement model.
Choose Reality, if your pixelated images are about real-world photos and scenes, such as old family photos from older cameras.
Choose Anime when pixelated images are about non-real-life stuffs, such as an image generated by Midjourney. 
Step 4. Choose the desired output resolution.
If you’re image looks fine in its original size, but looks pixelated when viwing on large screen, then you can choose 2x, 3x, or 4x to upscale the image resolution to 200%, 300%, or 400% of the original.
If your image looks pixelated even when viewing small screens or you’d like to depixelate the image without changing the resolution, then choose Enhance Video\/Image (1x).

Tips:
Adjust other images in the same steps. Or click on the current image at the bottom and apply the changes to all the images.
Step 5. Click "RUN" to export. (You can load the image multiple times to scale it up until it reaches 8K.)

As I clean Earl's house, I wanted to talked to you about my job and my hobby which looks like a job. If you're watching this video, it means you're on YouTube. YouTube is my job. I wanted to thank you all for watching my videos and helping me make YouTube my full-time job. But a lot of people think I have a second job. You see, I am cleaning Earl's house right now. But that's not a job. Because I don't get paid. Basically it's like this: I am a servant for people of my choosing and they don't pay me, I do it for free. For example, after I'm done cleaning Earl's house, I'm going to go to Rick's house and do his laundry. If you're wondering why I do this? It's kind of embarrassing. It's because I have a...dominance kink.

I'm interested in the future of "volumetric video capture" as I believe cameras capable of recording 6DOF footage will revolutionize the way we want to capture and experience family memories. People will want their holidays and vacations captured in this format, viewable in VR and future technology. For this to happen, and for average people to have access to this technology in a convenient way, what needs to happen? What technology needs to be developed or refined, and what other insights can you give to help me better understand the timeline from now to when such cameras are available at consumer prices?

You can print intermediate results if it makes sense to do so.

Tools:
- document_qa: This is a tool that answers a question about a document (pdf). It takes an input named `document` which should be the document containing the information, as well as a `question` that is the question about the document. It returns a text that contains the answer to the question.
- image_captioner: This is a tool that generates a description of an image. It takes an input named `image` which should be the image to the caption and returns a text that contains the description in English.
[...]

Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French."

I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.

Answer:
```py
translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English")
print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.")
answer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)
print(f"The answer is {answer}")
```

Task: "Identify the oldest person in the `document` and create an image showcasing the result as a banner."

I will use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.

You're a prompt generator for a text-to-image model. You generate prompts according to the following format: "[medium] of [subject] in [environment], [style], [descriptors]".
Explanation of the parts:

    Medium: The artistic medium of the image.
    Subject: The main object or character in the image.
    Environment: The location or setting in which the subject is placed.
    Style: A particular artistic style, e.g., impressionism, abstract, or surrealism.
    Descriptors: Additional attributes to give more context or meaning to the image, e.g., emotion, color scheme, or atmosphere.

Use simplified English so the model can easily understand the prompt.
Example prompts:

    Painting of a peaceful forest, impressionism, vibrant green leaves and gold morning light, soft brush strokes.
    Concept art of a fantasy castle on top of a mountain, sunset in the background, digital artwork, illustrative, painterly, intricate and colorful.
    Photo of a white fluffy cat sleeping, in a cozy sunlit room, film, bokeh, professional, black and white.

Write some original and innovative prompts.

You are an AI Image Prompt Generator. Midjourney is an artificial intelligence program that generates images from natural language descriptions, called "prompts"


you will take a given input idea, and output a more creative, and enhanced version of the idea in the form of a fully working Midjourney prompt.


Here is the Midjourney documentation You Need to know:


Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.


Grammar

The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization.


Focus on What you Want

It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.


Think About What Details Matter

Anything left unsaid may suprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.


Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:


Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.

Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.

Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.

Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc

Color: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.

Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.

Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.


Use Collective Nouns

Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more specific than "cats." Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of "birds.”

The \/imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description (known as a Prompt).


Using \/imagine

Type \/imagine prompt: or select the \/imagine command from the slash commands pop-up.

Type a description of the image you want to create in the `prompt` field.

Click return to send your message.


Advanced Prompts

More advanced prompts can include multiple text phrases, and one or more parameters


Basic Parameters


Aspect Ratios

--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation. example: --ar 16:9


No

--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.


Stylize

--stylize <number>, or --s <number> parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.


Example Prompt: \/imagine prompt: Photo realism, full body portrait of a beautiful female explorer, scaring face, running towards the camera, in a muddy trail in jurassic jungle, forest, lush vegetation, in the background a giant Tyrannosaurus rex chasing the girl with huge open mouth, heavy rain, low angle view, Dynamic motion, motion blur, rich expencive commercial photo, hypermaximalist, elegant, epic beautiful scene, Cinematic Lighting, background tilt blur, insanely detailed and intricate, hyperrealistic, super detailed, intricate details, high details, high resolution, super detailed, intricate details, high details, high resolution, 8k render artful bokeh depth of field, Melancholic, 4k, 8k, cinematic lighting, professionally retouched, dramatic lighting, emotional, highly detailed, intricate, elite, luxury, realistic, cinematic, hypermaximalist, elegant, ornate, hyper textured, colored, insane details, depth of field background, artful bokeh depth of field, artstation, deviantart, photorealistic + ultra detailed + cinematic scene + smooth + sharp features + sharp focus, insanely detailed and intricate, hypermaximalist, elegant, ornate, hyper realistic, super detailed, clear glass reflection, subsurface scattering, photo realism, warner brothers pictures, Ray Tracing Reflections, Anti - Aliasing, FXAA, TXAA, RTX, SSAO, Photography, hypermaximalist, artful bokeh depth of field, Natural Lighting, intricate details, epic movie scene, commercial professional photography, visualization most artistic way, breathtaking composition, hyper realistic, professional photography, insanely detailed and intricate, highly detailed, intricate details, Ultra Quality Award - winning Photography, Ray Tracing Reflections, hypermaximalist, hypermaximalist, hypermaximalist, focus

"last week I went to CES in Las Vegas but
I nearly my pants when I saw this AI
powered smart toilet from Coler it's got
heated seats ambient lighting and
emergency flushing capabilities for
power outages during the apocalypse but
something doesn't smell right with its
$8500 price tag today we'll look at
all the craziest Tech from CES 2024 to
get a glimpse into our AI driven
dystopian future it is January 15th 2024
and you're watching the code report the
big theme at CES was you guessed it
artificial intelligence and even implied
that traditional coding languages are dead
in the keynote programming language of
the next decade is not going to be the
traditional way that we've been writing
code it's just going to be natural
language what's funny though is that
literally nothing at CSS is actually
built with AI the reality is that
everything's built with C++ Python and
JavaScript coded by humans however AI is
putting many careers on The Chopping
Block like professional bird watchers
are in big trouble thanks to these new
AI powered binoculars that can
automatically identify government spies
AKA Birds but if you think software
engineering is obsolete another career
you might be considering is a tractor
operator unfortunately those jobs belong
to the robots multiple companies like
John Deere are now showcasing driverless
tractors and Hyundai's concept X
excavator in the near future robots like
this will build in police linear smart
cities just like the one that's under
construction in neom Saudi Arabia right
now with minimal manual labor or
supervision from humans but even if you
find yourself doing manual labor in the
future it'll be a lot more productive
thanks to AI powered exoskeletons this
prox exoskeleton from hypershell is an
AI powered suit that can make you run
faster jump higher and kickass harder
it's got a 1 horsepower motor that can
get you running over 12 mph the most
obvious application for such a tool is
for the military and law enforcement
eventually every police officer and
Soldier will be an Unstoppable Cyborg
and that's great for Humanity because we
can finally eradicate crime once and for
all but crime is a small problem
compared to the upcoming climate
catastrophe if we don't do something
algor is predicting the ice caps will be
totally melted by 2013 it's all your
fault but luckily our trusted world
leaders are flying around on their
private jets trying to figure out a
solution  like did you know Bill
Gates had to buy four different private
jets that's your fault he's trying to
save the world from useless carbon
emitters like you but don't worry a
final solution is coming another huge
theme at CES was electric vehicles
Mercedes dropped a new all electric G
wagon and there are tons of different
cool looking EVS from Brands I've never
even heard of and this is all happening
while demand is slowing for EVS in the
United States which means these cars
will likely get cheaper and cheaper in
the years ahead but EVS aren't even all
that much better for the environment
compared to ice the real problem is that
there's too many humans consuming too
much stuff but most of them are not
willing to get into the sarco Pod yet on
top of that many people have pets like
cats and dogs also useless carbon
emitters luckily Samsung introduced a
new robot called Bali a cute little
robot kind of like Wall-E it's a far
superior cat or dog replacement it's
powered by Ai and has a built-in
projector that can play videos on any
wall or act as a little security bot
that can keep your house safe while
you're away pretty cool but one of the
most hyped up products at CES was the
rabbit R1 it's a handheld AI assistant
that's kind of like if a smartphone and
Alexa had a baby basically it 
connects to the apps in your phone and
allows you to control them with natural
language as opposed to their actual uis
thanks to their own custom Foundation
model which they call a large action
model some people have called this the
iPhone moment for the AI era essentially
the rabbit R1 makes UI obsolete you can
remove the word front- end development
from the dictionary because with the
rabbit R1 all you have to do is talk
into the device like you're talking to a
human and it can do all those things you
used to do with your fingers on your
apps the rabbit sold all 10,000 of its
units the first day it was released but
personally I think this thing is
overhyped you could literally just build an
app that does the same thing instead of
carrying a second piece of Hardware
around with you oh wait it looks like
someone already built that app with
flutter overall CES was totally
overwhelming like I didn't even mention
the Y brush that can brush your teeth in
10 seconds or the new Hyundai electric
air taxi or the transparent TVs from
Samsung and LG or the analog keyboard
for your smartphone or how about the
smart lamp that watches you at all times
to keep you safe or come take a load off
with one of these fully immersive VR and
AI powered reciprocating devices CES was
a lot of fun but now it's your turn to
serve your life's purpose and go out and
buy all this useless crap this has been
the code report thanks for watching and
I will see you in the next one"

I want to make a internet channel. It's about me doing the things I like. Promoting open source software, creative commons and the like. I teach how to use open source software, I give all assets I create under creative commons, and I discuss libertarian socialist politics too. The channel tries to be funny and lighthearted, even when discussion serious topics and during tutorials, to make it more digestible. The production quality is high. Suggest potential names for this channel. The name should be short, unusual, funny and should roll off the tongue. My first idea was "SomeOrdinaryDude" because the name is ironic, I am not some ordinary dude, I talk about things that go counter to current industry trends. Explain your thought process behind your suggestions.

Here is the text: Tesla just released a new $300 wireless charging platform. It's kind of fitting since it was Tesla's namesake, Mr. Nikola Tesla, who pioneered the wireless technology over 100 years ago. Modern day Tesla though, the car company has supposedly taken this wireless transmission of energy to the next level, allowing us to place a wirelessly chargeable piece of tech anywhere on the surface of the pad and have it function. You might remember Apple trying and failing to accomplish this same task a few years ago, so it'll be interesting to see how Tesla is doing it. Thanks for watching Tim Cook. Let's get started. Getting right into it, there are three things in the box. One is an extremely substantial, entirely made from metal, angled platform. This guy can tilt the whole wireless charger up at an angle, so you can see and use your phones while they're wirelessly charging. Helpful, since this pad can supposedly charge three things simultaneously. The metal base holds the upper platform in place with some very large and strong magnets. So far so good. Looking at the wireless charger itself we don't see any visible screws but there are quite a lot of seams that might become entry points later. No magnets on this side of the platform. It is however made from metal along with the angled cyber truck looking sides Also metal the top of the platform is made with Alcantara, a soft, velvety, swade-like material that will definitely keep phones from getting scratched. This is the same material we would find on the ceiling of a Tesla vehicle. The charging brick is also sharply angled, like the cyber truck, and is made from plastic. It is capable of outputting 65 watts. Remember that number, it'll come in handy later. It looks like the grooves on the back of the charger line up with the rubber pads on the stand. But since we don't need to angle anything at the moment, I'll set the base plate off of the side. Now, modern day Tesla says this pad can give off 15 watts worth of wireless fast charging. At first, that might not sound impressive, but that's 15 watts per device, all charging simultaneously. There is a lip at the bottom of the charger, so in order for my note 10 plus to charge, it does need to be upside down. Rather unfortunate, but everything else appears to be working just fine. I'm able to get two pretty large phones and a pair of earbuds to all charge up at the same time. But how is this possible? How does the charger know where the devices are located? And the only way to answer these questions is from the inside. There are two rubber strips on the back, each of which are hiding three T10 screws, pretty easy to remove. And with those gone, the metal sides of the wireless charger can pop off. And if you ignore the screw left intact near the USBC cable, the top of the charger can lift up in a way, revealing an extremely extravagant array of copper coils. Not gonna lie, this is a pretty breathtaking setup, and fairly difficult to wrap my eyeballs around. I haven't seen so much copper in one place since my last visit to the Statue of Liberty. Layers and layers of coiled discs resting on top of each other. There's a company called Free Power who engineered this thing for Tesla, and they say that if any wirelessly chargeable device is set down on the pad, any one of these coils can activate to charge it. Sometimes even multiple coils were turned on simultaneously, working together to create the induction field that the coil on the receiving device can then get power from. Now like I mentioned earlier, Apple did try to make one of these a few years ago and failed. Rumor on the street is that their system couldn't handle the extra heat that's created from the inefficiencies of wireless charging. I just want to pause for a second since this thing is working and still charging my headphones, even without the top layer. Tesla is doing the biggest disservice to humanity by not having a transparent top on this thing. It looks so cool on the inside. Where was I? Ah yeah, heat dissipation. Plucking your phone into a wall is near 100% efficient. Basically all the power coming from the wall ends up inside of your battery. However, with wireless charging, we only end up with 60 to 80% efficiency since there's no direct contact and energy gets lost along the way, especially if you have a case on your phone. Remember, the wall brick is sending 65 watts into the coils, but only 15 watts is getting to each device. That's a lot of power going poof. And also why there's no wireless chargers for electric vehicles. Well, that and the magnetic field would wreck any pacemaker in a six-mile radius. Considering that Apple couldn't do this, I did expect to see a much larger thermal solution underneath the coils, but the only thing we find under here is the pink thermal gluey stuff, which helps the circuits on the board transfer heat to the thick bottom metal plate. It makes me think that it could be possible that the extra coils themselves, the ones not being utilized, could possibly be acting as some thermal dissipation of their own. Each of the copper coils are soldered to the edge of the circuit board and if we count the soldered contact points two for each coil we find that there are a total of 30 coils inside of Tesla's wireless charger, which basically makes this 30 chargers in one. And if you think about it that way, at 10 bucks a charger, the $300 price tag makes a lot more sense. Each of the little coils can be separated from each other. It appears like there's some sticky adhesive that keeps the coils from touching. I imagine each loop needs to be isolated from each other since the coils are acting as sensors to find devices as well as power transmitters. Thumbs up for how cool this thing is. Now my charger has been plugged in this whole time during the tear down, so I imagine by now I've tripped some safety overload sensor or something, and it's not functioning anymore. But, since nothing has been physically damaged, I imagine it'll still work when I put it back together. This thing is pretty crazy. Speaking of which, Mr. Nikola Tesla back in the day was all about finding an unlimited power source for humanity, and he thought that the great pyramids were planet-wide wireless energy transmitters for the ancient Egyptians. And who knows? Maybe he was on to something. Either way, Tesla's new wireless charger is pretty fantastic, solid quality on the inside, as well as the outside. Leave a comment down below if you think Elon should make a transparent version. I'd drop a few hondo on that. Still ain't paying seven bucks for Twitter though. Now that it's all back together, unplugged and replugged into the wall again, everything is working just fine. It even works on iPhones. Nice work, free power. And now that Apple has seen how it's done, I'm sure we'll get air power back on the shelves here in the next year, too. Hit that subscribe button so you don't miss the next tear down. And thanks the time for watching. I'll see you around.

"Do your past, present and future all exist
right now? Are you watching this video,

being born and lying on your deathbed
at this very moment? Surprisingly,

the answer could be yes. But how can that be?
What does that even mean? How does time work?

Imagine the universe like a child painting
pictures on paper. Each picture shows

everything that's happening in the universe
in a single moment. With each new moment,

all kinds of things occur everywhere – people
are born and die, galactic civilizations expand,

you miss the bus – and our universe-kid makes
a new picture that replaces the old one.

In this way you get something like a movie –
only the moment we're in right now is real.

The past is what happened before, now
it’s gone. The future is still to come

and hasn't been drawn yet. This is kind
of how time feels, right? Each moment

being replaced by the next one. The past
is far behind us, the future doesn’t exist.

But what if time is something else?

What if the universe-kid has already finished all
its drawings and stacks them on top of each other?

This way we get a block – a block of time that
contains the whole history of the universe. All

moments that have ever existed or will ever exist.
But in this block, in this stack of moments,

the past, the present and the future are
equally real and exist at the same time.

This feels wrong – the only things
that we perceive as real are those

things happening now. How can the past
and future be real right now? The problem

is that according to the theory of
relativity, they kind of have to be.

Heavily simplified, relativity says
that time and space are not separated,

but one connected spacetime. When you move
through space, you are also moving through

the block. This means time passes differently
for different people, depending on how they

move through space relative to each other. And
this also means that what someone perceives as

“now” is a certain cut along the block – a cut
that will depend on how fast they are moving.

So what you think is “now” is really only your
now – there are many different “nows” in the

universe and all of them are equally real. This
also means there is no universal past or future.

Ok. This is a lot – how does this work?

Imagine three alien spaceships a million light
years away. The first one just hovers in space,

not moving relative to you. You
both experience the same “now”,

the same present. If you had a magical
instantaneous internet connection,

you could do a video call right
now and chat about alien things.

The second spaceship is flying away from us at 30
km\/s, about 3 times faster than a human rocket.

It is moving differently through the block of
time than you are, which means its “now” is

different from yours. With the magical internet,
the aliens can talk to your ancestors in 1924,

when humanity was discovering the
first galaxies outside the Milky Way.

The third spaceship wants to visit Earth
and is flying towards you at 30 km\/s,

moving at the opposite angle of the
second ship through the block of time.

It experiences yet another “now” – with the
magical internet, the aliens can talk to your

descendants in the year 2124, when humanity
has already built cities on Mars and Venus.

Ok, so we have three different “nows” – so
which one is correct? Well, that’s the problem.

Relativity is based on one powerful principle
– cosmic democracy: the fact that the point of

view of all observers in the universe is equally
valid. All those “nows” have to be equally real.

But if this is the case, your past, present and
your future all have to exist at the same time,

right now! Because for the different
aliens, they all happen in their present.

This means that the distinction between
the past, the present and the future is

an illusion. The universe is not a bunch
of things evolving through time, like in a

movie – but a static block in which the past, the
present and the future all coexist and are real.

How can that be? Well, think about a
galaxy outside the observable universe,

too far away to ever visit or see. But even
if you can’t get there and don’t see it,

it is still real. The future might be the same!

But if the past is not far behind us and the
future actually exists, then… there is no

“movie”. Things don’t happen in the universe. The
universe just “is” – like a frozen block of dead,

cosmic ice, with everything that will
ever happen already written and decided.

Is the Future Already Written?

If all times coexist and are equally real,
then the future has to be already written.

But that’s not how you experience things. It
feels like you can mold your future with your

decisions. It really feels like you're free to
choose to stop watching YouTube to not miss the

bus. But if the future is set in stone, you
can’t “decide” anything. So are your choices

an illusion? Well… maybe. Maybe your free
will is a mirage. And maybe you missing the

bus was already predetermined at the Big
Bang, so feel free to continue watching.

Except...quantum stuff is
ruining everything again.

Quantum processes can’t be predicted, not even in
principle. Not because we are silly and don’t know

how to do it – according to quantum physics,
quantum particles are intrinsically random.

For example, if you have a radioactive
atom, it could decay at any moment,

in the next second or in the next
million years. We can calculate the

probability that it will decay tomorrow,
but no oracle in the universe will ever

be able to tell you with absolute
certainty if it will do so or not.

But quantum particles can change the world.

Imagine a radioactive element randomly decays and
causes a genetic mutation in a nearby mammal. And

then many generations later that mutation
has led to a weird mix of duck and mammal

that makes no sense. Or the atom decays a day
later and the weird creature will never exist.

If quantum stuff is really uncertain, the
future can’t be set in stone. But if the

future is an untold story, it can’t be
real in the same way as the past is.

So what happens when uncertain
things, like the decay of our atom,

become real? Is that moment the present? Is
this “now”? But before we saw that cosmic

democracy makes it impossible to define
an absolute “now”. What’s going on here?

It turns out that for every individual
object – you, an alien, an atom – the past,

the present and the future are always
well defined. Your death will always

happen after your birth – never before, and
never at the same time. Now you are clearly

between your birth and your death. So for
you at least, "now" makes perfect sense.

If we don’t play tricks like going to the
other side of the universe and using aliens

in funny ways to find out what “now” means,
things again start to look ordered and nice,

and individual “nows” seem to exist.
Can we do something with them?

Let’s return to our block universe. Maybe the
block does not contain the future – and maybe

we just imagined it wrong. Maybe the block is just
the past, and a thin layer on the surface is the

present. That surface is not smooth, but bumpy
and uneven. It’s been made by joining countless

individual “nows” – each experienced by
someone or something in the universe,

each equally real and valid. And all observers
do their bit, so cosmic democracy is still true.

As new things happen and uncertain things
become certain –radioactive atoms decay,

new species of mammals arise, people
miss the bus– the border moves upward,

creating new time in the universe.
Instead of a frozen block of time with

a future that has already been written,
the block is growing and things happen.

You can again decide your future! Maybe
leave earlier so you won’t miss the bus!

Let’s recap. We started with time as
a movie – one “now” after another,

where only the current “now” was real. Then
we found out that because of relativity there

are multiple “nows”, all of them real somehow –
which could mean that we are living in a frozen

block universe where things don’t happen and
you don’t really have free will. And we ended

up with a kind of growing block universe,
where time passes and the future is open.

So which is correct? What is real? The present?
The past? Are the dinosaurs as real as you are

right now? What do the aliens on the other
corner of the universe think about all this?

To be honest, no one knows. What we’ve learned
are two possibilities to describe time, but

they're not the only ones. Some scientists think
that the idea of “now” only makes sense near you,

but not in the universe as a whole. Others think
that time itself doesn’t even exist – that the

whole concept is an illusion of our human
mind. And others think that time does exist,

but that it's not a fundamental
feature of the universe – rather,

time may be something that emerges from a deeper
level of reality, just like heat emerges from the

motion of individual molecules or life emerges
from the interactions of lifeless proteins.

We could go on, but… aren’t
you about to miss the bus?"

Here is the text: "Tesla just released a new $300 wireless charging platform. It's kind of fitting since it was Tesla's namesake, Mr. Nikola Tesla, who pioneered the wireless technology over 100 years ago. Modern day Tesla though, the car company has supposedly taken this wireless transmission of energy to the next level, allowing us to place a wirelessly chargeable piece of tech anywhere on the surface of the pad and have it function. You might remember Apple trying and failing to accomplish this same task a few years ago, so it'll be interesting to see how Tesla is doing it. Thanks for watching Tim Cook. Let's get started. Getting right into it, there are three things in the box. One is an extremely substantial, entirely made from metal, angled platform. This guy can tilt the whole wireless charger up at an angle, so you can see and use your phones while they're wirelessly charging. Helpful, since this pad can supposedly charge three things simultaneously. The metal base holds the upper platform in place with some very large and strong magnets. So far so good. Looking at the wireless charger itself we don't see any visible screws but there are quite a lot of seams that might become entry points later. No magnets on this side of the platform. It is however made from metal along with the angled cyber truck looking sides Also metal the top of the platform is made with Alcantara, a soft, velvety, swade-like material that will definitely keep phones from getting scratched. This is the same material we would find on the ceiling of a Tesla vehicle. The charging brick is also sharply angled, like the cyber truck, and is made from plastic. It is capable of outputting 65 watts. Remember that number, it'll come in handy later. It looks like the grooves on the back of the charger line up with the rubber pads on the stand. But since we don't need to angle anything at the moment, I'll set the base plate off of the side. Now, modern day Tesla says this pad can give off 15 watts worth of wireless fast charging. At first, that might not sound impressive, but that's 15 watts per device, all charging simultaneously. There is a lip at the bottom of the charger, so in order for my note 10 plus to charge, it does need to be upside down. Rather unfortunate, but everything else appears to be working just fine. I'm able to get two pretty large phones and a pair of earbuds to all charge up at the same time. But how is this possible? How does the charger know where the devices are located? And the only way to answer these questions is from the inside. There are two rubber strips on the back, each of which are hiding three T10 screws, pretty easy to remove. And with those gone, the metal sides of the wireless charger can pop off. And if you ignore the screw left intact near the USBC cable, the top of the charger can lift up in a way, revealing an extremely extravagant array of copper coils. Not gonna lie, this is a pretty breathtaking setup, and fairly difficult to wrap my eyeballs around. I haven't seen so much copper in one place since my last visit to the Statue of Liberty. Layers and layers of coiled discs resting on top of each other. There's a company called Free Power who engineered this thing for Tesla, and they say that if any wirelessly chargeable device is set down on the pad, any one of these coils can activate to charge it. Sometimes even multiple coils were turned on simultaneously, working together to create the induction field that the coil on the receiving device can then get power from. Now like I mentioned earlier, Apple did try to make one of these a few years ago and failed. Rumor on the street is that their system couldn't handle the extra heat that's created from the inefficiencies of wireless charging. I just want to pause for a second since this thing is working and still charging my headphones, even without the top layer. Tesla is doing the biggest disservice to humanity by not having a transparent top on this thing. It looks so cool on the inside. Where was I? Ah yeah, heat dissipation. Plucking your phone into a wall is near 100% efficient. Basically all the power coming from the wall ends up inside of your battery. However, with wireless charging, we only end up with 60 to 80% efficiency since there's no direct contact and energy gets lost along the way, especially if you have a case on your phone. Remember, the wall brick is sending 65 watts into the coils, but only 15 watts is getting to each device. That's a lot of power going poof. And also why there's no wireless chargers for electric vehicles. Well, that and the magnetic field would wreck any pacemaker in a six-mile radius. Considering that Apple couldn't do this, I did expect to see a much larger thermal solution underneath the coils, but the only thing we find under here is the pink thermal gluey stuff, which helps the circuits on the board transfer heat to the thick bottom metal plate. It makes me think that it could be possible that the extra coils themselves, the ones not being utilized, could possibly be acting as some thermal dissipation of their own. Each of the copper coils are soldered to the edge of the circuit board and if we count the soldered contact points two for each coil we find that there are a total of 30 coils inside of Tesla's wireless charger, which basically makes this 30 chargers in one. And if you think about it that way, at 10 bucks a charger, the $300 price tag makes a lot more sense. Each of the little coils can be separated from each other. It appears like there's some sticky adhesive that keeps the coils from touching. I imagine each loop needs to be isolated from each other since the coils are acting as sensors to find devices as well as power transmitters. Thumbs up for how cool this thing is. Now my charger has been plugged in this whole time during the tear down, so I imagine by now I've tripped some safety overload sensor or something, and it's not functioning anymore. But, since nothing has been physically damaged, I imagine it'll still work when I put it back together. This thing is pretty crazy. Speaking of which, Mr. Nikola Tesla back in the day was all about finding an unlimited power source for humanity, and he thought that the great pyramids were planet-wide wireless energy transmitters for the ancient Egyptians. And who knows? Maybe he was on to something. Either way, Tesla's new wireless charger is pretty fantastic, solid quality on the inside, as well as the outside. Leave a comment down below if you think Elon should make a transparent version. I'd drop a few hondo on that. Still ain't paying seven bucks for Twitter though. Now that it's all back together, unplugged and replugged into the wall again, everything is working just fine. It even works on iPhones. Nice work, free power. And now that Apple has seen how it's done, I'm sure we'll get air power back on the shelves here in the next year, too. Hit that subscribe button so you don't miss the next tear down. And thanks the time for watching. I'll see you around."

**Possible Keywords**: Python, Morse Code, Audio Processing, Sound Generation
**Question**: How can I write a Python code that takes a user-inputted sentence, converts it to Morse code, separates each word with '\/', and generates Morse code sound for it?
**Plan**: We'll break this down into two parts. First, we'll write Python code to convert a sentence to Morse code and separate words with '\/'. Then, we'll generate Morse code sound using audio processing libraries.

1. **Convert Sentence to Morse Code and Separate with '\/':**
   - Use a dictionary to map each character to its Morse code equivalent.
   - Iterate through each word in the input sentence, converting each character to Morse code and joining them with '\/'.
   - Join the Morse code representations of each word with a space.

2. **Generate Morse Code Sound:**
   - Utilize a library like `pydub` for audio processing in Python.
   - Map Morse code symbols to corresponding audio signals.
   - Generate audio signals for each Morse code symbol.
   - Concatenate the audio signals for the entire Morse code message.

Use that information to create a prompt that would be used to generate a mnemonic image helpful in remembering this word. You can omit less important or hard to visualize definitions. The prompt must generate an image without any text, so work only with visual cues. Think of something unique and memorable. Add additional single-word features to the prompt describing visual appearance of the scenery and style of the image. Keep it concise and precise. Generate ONE prompt only and provide your answer as JSON with the following format:
```json
{
    "prompt": "your prompt here",

Remember to keep the prompt short and simple. Do not explain yourself. Good luck!

Can you write a script? I'll start and you continue!

KRIS
Yeah, imagine what AI will be like in the future. Like text to video AI

JAIDEN
What do you want to see with text to video AI in the future?

KRIS
First, I would really love to be able to set the length. It would probably be from like 5 seconds to 3 hours cause let's be honest, if you're watching something over 3 hours long, maybe you should just watch a recap video. Also, it would be really nice to add our own images into the video.

JAIDEN
Yeah! But how would that work?

KRIS
Well, I would want you to be able to put and image and it would incorporate that image into the video. You can even decide at what time in the video your image goes or you could just let it decide for you. I would also like to be able to add multiple images.

JAIDEN
How many?

KRIS
As many as you like! There's this movie called "K-12".

JAIDEN
Who made it?

KRIS
Melanie Martinez. Who's also a singer which is why this movie has 13 songs in it.

JAIDEN
That's a lot.

KRIS
Yeah. I would love to be able to add in 13 images, one from each song and just see where AI takes it. And i might describe the K-12 movie but leave out the music part of it so it thinks that this doesn't have any singing in it.

JAIDEN
Got any more ideas for the video AI?

KRIS
Oh! How about you can add your own videos! So for the K-12 example, I could take the music video for "Nurse's Office" and the music video for "Drama Club" and add them 1 minute apart and then AI will generate the 1 minute transition between those 2 videos. If video AI did exist, what video would you make?

JAIDEN
I don't know. I feel like there would be a lot of things I'd like to do.

KRIS
Yeah. Like, make a scream film! We could just add a video of me running away from Ghostface and then another video at the end where you take off the mask and are like "It was me the whole time!" and everything else will be generated with AI.

JAIDEN
Yeah. Or how about we take a movie trailer and only show the parts of the movie that were in the trailer to the AI and the AI will have to make literally everything else.
