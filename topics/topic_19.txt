prepare claims as per indian intellectual property patent practice using the following "DC Motor (1) is coupled to actuation assembly that consist of shaft coupler (2), lead screw (3) and bearing (4),. Lead nut (5) and actuation tube (6) are assembled together and deliver the required stroke by virtue of lead screw (3). Multi rated compression spring (7) is placed between the DC motor (1) and top end support (8). Top end support (8) is assembled to actuation tube (6) and thus compresses and decompresses the multi rated compression spring (7) as it extends and retracts. Ball socket end mountings (9) are fastened on the top end support (8) and bottom end support (10) by which power strut can be assembled in the vehicle. 
Power strut mechanism is enclosed with bottom outer (11) cover and inner cover (12) that actuates along with actuation tube (6).
Working:
For opening, output of the DC motor (1) is captured by the lead screw (3) via shaft coupler (2) and drives the lead nut (5) along with the actuation tube (6) to extend the power strut, refer fig. 5 and 6. During initial travel (mm), multi rated compression spring (7) with high stiffness span assists the DC motor (1) by delivering the high initial force requirement. As shown in the graph of Figure 1,  at the spring deflection of 540mm, conventional spring delivers the force of 850 N to 865 N (represented with black line) whereas the multi rated compression spring delivers the force of 900 N to 925 N (represented by red line) which is almost 8% more than the conventional spring.
In terms of opening angle of the trunk, max force delivered by the conventional compression spring at an opening angle of 0° to 20° is around 850 N (represented by yellow line), whereas multi rated compression spring delivers the maximum force of 925 N (represented by black line).
 This additional force delivered by the multi rated compression spring reduces the output force requirement from the DC motor. This helps to operate the DC motor closer to its maximum efficiency curve as the force output from the DC motor is more linear and doesn’t deflect much from its mean value. 
 
Once the initial phase ends, rest of the travel is assisted by the same multi rated compression spring (7) with reduced stiffness span.
For closing, output of the DC motor (1) is captured by the lead screw (3) via shaft coupler (2) and drives the lead nut (5) along with the actuation tube (6) to retract the power strut. During this travel, multi rated spring (7) gets compressed by the output force from the DC motor (1) and the weight acting on the multi rated compression spring (7)

Features:
Multi rated compression spring (7) design is unique and offers two different spring rates, (refer fig. 8) delivering two different output forces required for efficient operation of the power strut. This spring will provide more force during the initial opening of the power strut thereby reducing the load on the DC motor (1)"

Promotion of active mobility is a key pillar of energy-efficient transport concepts that aim to minimize energy consumption per capita and kilometer. Active mobility is one of the most direct methods of achieving energy efficiency in the transport sector. By consciously managing traffic flows and promoting efficient means of transport, cities and municipalities can reduce energy consumption per capita and kilometer. However, the special feature of active mobility is that the energy used for locomotion by one's own strength comes from food – ultimately solar energy is used, which is stored in plant or animal products. The efficiency of this energy conversion is extremely high compared to the operation of motorized vehicles, so that energy consumption is drastically reduced on an individual level.

Active mobility not only has the advantage of being emission-free and energy-efficient, but it also promotes the health and well-being of the population. Cities that invest in infrastructure for active mobility thus create not only an environmentally friendly atmosphere, but also contribute to improving public health. By building safe bicycle paths, pedestrian crossings, and traffic-calmed zones, active mobility is made more attractive and accessible, so that it becomes the preferred choice for a larger part of the population.

However, there are also some supporting measures within the framework of alternative mobility concepts that are necessary to create and maintain the prerequisites for active mobility. These include the creation of a city of short distances, where important goals such as workplaces, shopping facilities, educational institutions and leisure activities are close together, thus reducing the need for long journeys. The integration of active mobility into public transport, such as the provision of bicycle parking facilities at train stations and stops, facilitates multimodal transport, where people travel short distances on foot or by bicycle and switch to public transport for longer distances. In addition, sharing offers support the flexible use of different means of transport and enable optimal utilization of the transport infrastructure.

The promotion of sharing projects also contributes to energy efficiency. Carsharing, bikesharing and similar models not only avoid traffic jams, but also ensure better use of existing resources. When vehicles are used by several people, the energy consumption per user decreases, as fewer vehicles are needed overall and these are used more efficiently.

In conclusion, it can be said that the combination of active mobility and supporting mobility concepts has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption in the transport sector. The promotion of active mobility is at the heart of these efforts and is complemented by intelligent urban planning and sustainable transport policy. These holistic approaches contribute to reducing the ecological footprint while also improving the quality of life in urban areas.

Text: “The coach has been equipped with an H2-PACK kit. Safra, a French company that specializes in the renovation of passenger transport equipment and a pioneer in hydrogen mobility, presented a hydrogen coach at the recent UITP Summit that took place in Barcelona last week. The hydrogen retrofitted coach features the company’s H2-PACK kit, which has been designed to convert a combustion-powered intercity coach into a zero-emission vehicle. The H2-PACK retrofit kit is fully designed and assembled by Safra. The retrofit kit allows the vehicle’s diesel engine to be transformed into a zero-emission hydrogen-electric powertrain. The original diesel engine is replaced by a 350 kW Dana electric motor that receives power from a 100 kW (70 kW useful) Plastic Omnium fuel cell. According to Safra, the H2 used by the hydrogen coach is stored in six tanks, which have been integrated into an area of the vehicle that is separated from the passengers by a watertight, ventilated and secure partition. The tanks allow for 35 kg of hydrogen to be carried on board, delivering a maximum range of 500 km. The hydrogen coach presented at the event belongs to the Occitanie Region. This is France’s second-largest region by surface area, and it has commissioned Safra with retrofitting 15 of its intercity coaches.”

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

"In today's fast-paced world, owning a car has become a necessity for most families. In the intricate dance of family decisions, the acquisition of a car emerges as a pivotal step, offering a host of advantages that harmonize and enhance the family's daily rhythm.

A car isn't just wheels and steel; it's the silent symphony of ease, weaving seamlessly into the family's day-to-day life. It bears great convenience, liberating families from the shackles of limited mobility. With it comes the smooth ride for errands, the effortless commute, and the chance to embark on impromptu family journeys. The car, a companion in every journey, turns mundane chores into a symphony of ease.

Beyond convenience, the car is the liberator, granting families a ticket to independence. It liberates families from the constraints of stuffy public transport, allowing them the autonomy to chart their course. The car grants the freedom to navigate family life at one's own pace.

With a car comes shared adventures and a sense of togetherness, it becomes the vessel that carries laughter, spontaneous detours, and the making of cherished memories. It is the sanctuary where the family unfolds stories, forming a shared language of memories.

In conclusion, owning another car can offer greater convenience, flexibility, independence, and resale value to my family. Ultimately, the car transcends being a mere vehicle; it becomes the orchestrator, conducting the family's dynamics, fostering autonomy, and etching shared adventures that enrich the family's story."

was the following essay written by a human or AI:

As awareness about climate change and the urgent need for environmental resiliability grows, the idea of reducing personal car usage is gaining momentum. The
benefits of limiting individual car usage include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, and the amelioration of city life. Viable templates for successful car reduction exist in communities such as Vauban in Germany, urban transformations in Bogota, Colombia, and in trend shifts across the United States.

The suburban pioneer community of Vauban in Germany is a successful example of dramatically reduced car usage (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). In Vauban, 70% of families do not own cars. As a result, green spaces flourish, noise pollution is lessened, and residents report increased happiness and decreased stress levels. Furthermore, the design of the community encourages walking and biking, fostering a community of environmental awareness while reducing carbon emissions. ""Smart planning"" initiatives, as seen in Vauban, have begun to extend globally as a more sustainable alternative to car-dependent suburbs.

Consider this scenario and provide best mechanism design game theoretical solution with mathematical formulation  :

In a ride-sharing service, the principal (the ride-sharing platform) aims to maximize customer satisfaction by providing fast and affordable rides. The agents (drivers) want to maximize their income and minimize idle time. The principal-agent problem arises because drivers may choose to cherry-pick rides based on location or distance, potentially leading to uneven service coverage.
In some cases, in rush hour in certain locations, drivers know that the demand is high so they do not accept the customer request until the price rises. this is a problem in customer satisfaction. Pleas e revise the model to incorporate this idea and suggest if there any incentive compatible mechanism for them 



Drivers make decisions about whether to accept or reject ride requests based on factors like distance, traffic, and potential income.
The ride-sharing platform observes driver behavior and sets dynamic pricing or incentive mechanisms to encourage desired behavior.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.
