"You are given a string word containing distinct lowercase English letters.

Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 2 is mapped with ["a","b","c"], we need to push the key one time to type "a", two times to type "b", and three times to type "c" .

It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. You need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string word.

Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type word after remapping the keys.

An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that 1, *, #, and 0 do not map to any letters.

Input: word = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"a" -> one push on key 2
"b" -> one push on key 3
"c" -> one push on key 4
"d" -> one push on key 5
"e" -> one push on key 6
Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

Input: word = "xycdefghij"
Output: 12
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"x" -> one push on key 2
"y" -> two pushes on key 2
"c" -> one push on key 3
"d" -> two pushes on key 3
"e" -> one push on key 4
"f" -> one push on key 5
"g" -> one push on key 6
"h" -> one push on key 7
"i" -> one push on key 8
"j" -> one push on key 9
Total cost is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

In recent trends, smart buildings have become the base for the Internet of Things (IoT). The usage of the internet is increased by connecting the devices in the homes to make the places more comfortable, provident, delightful, and secure. The proposed approach addresses a security aspect in smart home technologies, namely the door lock system. The door lock system determines the security by allowing the owner to monitor the buildings with a Smartphone-controlled, Bluetooth-connected system using Arduino UNO. Users can open or close the door lock by installing the developed android application in devices like tablets, smartphones, laptops, etc. by providing the login credentials like username and password which is verified in the database over the internet. If the credentials are invalid, the buzzer rings and an SMS alert is sent to the owner of the building which enhances the security. This approach can further be scaled to commercial sectors like ATMs, vending machines, etc. by using other wireless communication.
