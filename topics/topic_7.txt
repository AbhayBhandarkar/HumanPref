Paraphrase and give me a short (under 40 words) version of the following text:

"The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits slumped by 19,000 to 202,000 on the week ending December 9th, well below market expectations of 220,000, to mark the lowest level of new claims in two months. The result marked a reversal from higher readings in the two prior weeks, underscoring relative tightness in the US labor market and adding leeway for the Federal Reserve to hold its terminal rate for longer should inflation remain stubborn. In the meantime, continuing claims rose by 11,000 to 1,876,000 in the last week of November, but undershot market expectations of 1,887,000. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims plummeted by 46,316 to 248,299, with considerable declines in New York (-6,581) and Pennsylvania (-4,362). The four-week moving average, which removes week-to-week volatility, fell by 7,750 to 213,250."

Cem Karsan said this on X: 

"Let me Clarify. Macro, in this context, I would define as big picture qualitative things that effect global policy, economics, peace\/war, trade, politics, consumer\/business preference, etc. 

Things like treasury issuance, QE\/QT, buybacks etc, which in theory would be an indirect offshoot (not always) of these macro realities are a direct liquidity input to market supply and demand. As such, these ‘flows’ should clearly be used as an input, in concert with, often bigger (depending on where in time and calendar cycle and in the context of positioning), flows driven by market structure mechanics and positioning over any reasonably short period for market analysis."

"US stocks traded mostly lower on Thursday, with the Dow Jones down around 150 points, the Nasdaq falling 0.4% and the S&P 500 retreating 0.3% as traders digested economic data and the latest earnings reports. Walmart declined 7% after the company expressed concerns about the outlook for consumer spending. Cisco Systems saw nearly a 12% drop due to weak guidance for the current quarter and full year, while Palo Alto Networks fell over 6.5% after issuing a disappointing forecast on billings. Conversely, Macy's saw a rise of over 7% as profits exceeded expectations. Meanwhile, on the data front, weekly jobless claims exceeded expectations, reaching a 3-month high, and suggesting a cooling job market. Additionally, US import prices fell the most in 7 months and export prices were down the most in 5 months. With markets now indicating zero chance of a December interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, the likelihood of a rate cut in the middle of next year is increasing."

Javier Milei's minister of economy just announced an "emergency package" of measures to completely balance the budget in 2024 equivalent to over 5% of GDP.

This would be equivalent to a $1.4 trillion austerity package in a single year in the U.S. economy.

The measures include:
- Letting go of every public employee who has been employed for less than 1 year
- Abolishing all government publicity and related spending for projects.
- Appointed government positions are cut by 34%
- No more transfers to local governments

By contrast, weaker-than-expected purchasing manager surveys for manufacturing and services released this week showed a bigger slowdown in activity than expected. The ISM’s factory gauge hit the lowest level since the spring of 2020. Other data this week showed a slide in job openings and an increase in the trend for jobless claims. “We’re getting a sense that there is some substantial amount of constriction in credit,” said Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg Television. “Recession probabilities are going up at this point. And I think the Fed’s got very, very difficult decisions ahead of it — with very much two-sided risk.”

Please read my cover letter and see what would stand out to a recruiter for Ironclad CLM. This is for a technical support engineer role. Thanks. 

Dear Ironclad Hiring Team,

As a customer experience specialist with a proven track record of success, I work with global fintech companies to increase their customer satisfaction, elevate quality of service, and streamline operations to reduce friction and increase efficiency helping our team win big and our clients win even bigger.

The initial impression we make as personal and professional brands greatly influences the integrity and longevity of great customer relationships. Drawing from my diverse background in sales, hospitality, fintech, web3, and web-based product support, I’ve mastered the art of adaptability – delivering quality, speed, enchantment, and professionalism. To nurture and extend client relationships, I leverage Customer Lifecycle Management (CLM) principles. By building trust with warmth, transparency, and humility, I work with my clients to find creative solutions that meet their needs by thinking both inside and outside the box. Together, we build a box encompassing their personalized solution exceeding their expectations. This level of white-glove support is in my DNA and my absolute pleasure.

During my tenure at Kraken, I’ve deepened my domain expertise and refined my approach to customer support with an emphasis on improved CX, security and threat management, workflow improvements, and cross-team collaboration. Notable achievements include a 500% productivity boost from 100 to 500+ tickets resolved per month, meeting service level agreements of 98% with a consistent 96% or greater QA score.

My most recent experience is not directly related, but I do believe the skills are transferable making me a great asset on the Ironclad frontline team. I also believe that you will see a good return on your investment if given an opportunity to move forward with my candidacy.

Can you please write a response responding to this request for a reference? My boss asked me to draft it for me and its for me. I will give you the questions and some notes on the ideal response. 
“If possible, could you please provide answers to the questions below at your earliest convenience? When did you work with Michelle, and in what capacity? I have been Michelle's manager on a consultancy for the past 4-5 months. What was it like to work with Michelle? Working with Michelle has been great, she has worked hard and done much more than the bare basics to ensure that her deliverables are comprehensive and will support the project over its lifespan. How have you seen Michelle demonstrate strong investigative skills? If possible, please provide an example. Michelle has undertaken a lot of research and anlysis in her recent agroforestry consultancy with the Thailand team, and she has a strong capacity to take in information, analyse and summarize it. For example, Michelle has become very knowledgeable on a carbon financing plaform that we are considering for our work in Thailand, and has been able to guide the team in how to think about and consider the potential of the platform for achieving the project goals.  
Are there any aspects of the job where you think Michelle might not be as strong or might need some development, and if so, what would those be? 
Michelle presents a lot of information with her work, and it is not always presented in a way that makes the priority information clear. This is an area that I think can be developed through communications and media or marketing training. 
Can you share your impressions about Michelle's work style, interpersonal demeanor, and approach to investigative\/analytical work? 
Michelle is extremely self-directed and capable of independent work, her work style is professional and she is reliable. Her demeanor is friendly and helpful, she seems to enjoy working and helping a team. We largely worked together remotely but had a chance to work together in person during a field trip and she was equally professional, helpful and reliable. I would classify her approach to work as serious and thorough. 
As an investigator for Transparentem, individuals must be highly flexible and possess the ability to build strong relationships with people with a wide range of backgrounds. How have you seen Michelle demonstrate this in your work together?
Michelle made good relationships with our Thailand team quickly, and her time in country (11 days in early November) was successful with a lot accomplished in a short time, and helpful in bringing the agroforestry project forward. Her  international experience is quite clear in that she was able to organize her own logistics effortlessly and adapted quickly and easily to the Thai context, including working with translators and communicating non-verbally.

Due in part to strong Q1 2023 numbers and a surge in demand, the US solar market is now expected to triple in size over the next five years, according to a new report.

According to the “US Solar Market Insight Q2 2023 report,” released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, the solar market is now expected to achieve a total installed solar capacity of 378 gigawatts (GW) by 2028.

The US solar industry installed 6.1 GW of solar capacity and had its best first quarter in history in Q1 2023, due to the easing of supply chain challenges and delayed solar projects moving forward.

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act has also spurred a surge of new manufacturing announcements, with US module capacity expected to rise from fewer than 9 GW today to more than 60 GW by 2026. At least 16 GW of solar module factories are under construction as of the end of Q1 2023.

Despite customer hesitancy, the residential segment installed 1.6 GW of solar capacity in Q1 2023, a 30% increase from Q1 2022. The residential market segment is on track to add 36 GW of solar over the next five years, growing at an average annual rate of 6%.

The commercial market also had a record first quarter, with 391 megawatts (MW) installed, putting it on track for 12% growth in 2023.

Florida was the top solar state in Q1 2023, due to 1.46 GW of utility-scale solar installations. Florida installed more than 70% more solar capacity in Q1 than California, the No. 2 state.

The utility-scale market saw a strong first quarter and a record 3.8 GW of installed solar capacity. More module importers were able to satisfy documentation requirements under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which enabled more solar equipment to make it to project sites.

However, the community solar segment installed 212 MW, a 13% decrease from Q1 2022, due in large part to ongoing interconnection challenges.

This marked the second consecutive decrease in wholesale inventories, driven by non-durable goods (-0.5% vs -0.7% in October), especially chemicals (-3.3%), apparel (-1.8%) and groceries (-1.6%). On the other hand, stocks for durable goods remained flat for the second month running, as increases seen in machinery (1.3%), miscellaneous durable goods (0.6%), professional equipment (0.3%) and furniture (0.1%) were outweighed by declines in inventories of automotive (-1.1%), lumber (-1.1%), computers equipment (-1%) and hardware (-0.8%).

As the manager of Rachael, I want to provide the reflection on her annual performance in term of how she create values with what types of behaviors based on the following review. The stated area of company values are "WE PUT PATIENTS FIRST", "WE FOLLOW THE SCIENCE", "WE PLAY TO WIN", "WE DO THE RIGHT THING", "WE ARE ENTREPRENEURAL". Limit the reflect to no more than two paragraphs. Do not quote the company values directly.
Reflecting on 2023, I am incredibly proud of Rachael's accomplishments. When Jesper was on summer vacation, Rachael stepped up and temporarily assumed the project management role for DS&AA. She did an excellent job maintaining the project portfolio and preparing project update decks for our interactions with the leadership team, receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback.
In addition to her project management duties, Rachael was also tasked with leading a taskforce to produce a "service catalogue" for our department. Despite the ambiguous asks and the need for coordination and collaboration with various groups, Rachael excelled in her role as taskforce leader. She also managed the SigMAP project for omics signature analysis, keeping the project organized and on track while also coordinating stakeholder engagements and contributing from a non-technical point of view. Rachael's contributions to our team in 2023 were invaluable and I am grateful for all that she has done. She will be hard to replace as we scale up the project in 2024.
Overall, Rachael has consistently demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility and a willingness to commit her time and effort to improving her own skillset such as RFA and insight analysis. She has taken advantage of every learning opportunity that has come her way and has become more confident and assertive as a result. I am extremely happy to see her grow professionally in her new role.
At the same time, Rachael's contributions to our team have had a significant impact. Her ability to keep projects on track, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and contribute valuable insights from a non-technical point of view has been invaluable. Her leadership of the taskforce to produce the service catalogue was particularly impressive, as she was able to coordinate and collaborate with various groups to produce a purpose statement and framework that accurately reflects our department's strengths and capabilities.
Rachael's professional growth and contributions to the team will be greatly missed as she moves on to her new role. However, I am confident that she will continue to excel and make a positive impact wherever she goes. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with her and wish her all the best in her future endeavors.
Rachael continued to make significant contributions within her expanded portfolio. Her accomplishments for the patient data products such as interim RDM solution and ScoCol tool are great examples of her drives to serve the patients while improving her skill sets. Rachael was able to leverage her creativity, curiosity to add value to the team. Her impacts were appreciated by her collaborators in many ways.

We’ve also come to rely on her more for project coordination and management. As the portfolio manager for the group Rachael was tenacious in keeping track of the group activities and whatever the LT asked for. She
is serious about the responsibility and willing to commit her time and effort to improve her own skillset with every learning opportunity.
Over the year, I’ve seen Rachael become more forthcoming in sharing her ideas, perspective and recommendations which has added a lot of value in many places. I always would hear feedback on how easy it was to work with Rachael. The work that she has done in this space will impact the entire DS&AI Function to ensure our goals are measurable and within our control. We would not have gotten to where we are today on this without Rachael’s involvement.

As a Project Manager, I was responsible for managing the Shell Draugen umbilical Installation Project, this is a construction of umbilical from onshore to offshore Draugen Oil Field platform at North Sea.

During the construction phase, I discovered discrepancies in the safety reports submitted by a major subcontractor which didn’t align with Construction Design Management (CDM 2015) regulation. The reports, crucial for ensuring compliance with SHEQ regulations, were filled with inconsistencies and potential hazards overlooked. This raised concerns about their commitment to safety and transparency, jeopardizing trust and potentially delaying project milestones.

Inconsistencies in the safety reports such as: Incomplete Hazard Identification, Inaccurate Risk Assessment, Missing Safety Controls, Contradictory Compliance Statements.

improve it and make it clear: "Mercon’s situation is still pretty much in the air and, although outlook isn’t great, we still don’t know hoe it’s going to pan out, so it’s difficult to make a meaningful “lessons learned” exercise. 

In my view, there are three main factors that affected Mercon’s specific case: (i) the majority of the inventory was located in jurisdictions in which recovery will end up being much lower than the advance ratio they were being financed at; (ii) complicated shareholding structure; (iii) low equity level for this type of financing. I wouldn’t say that each of these factors alone should be avoided, but the company of the three is definitely pretty risky."

"The US economy expanded an annualized 5.2% in Q3 2023, higher than 4.9% in the preliminary estimate, and forecasts of 5%. It marks the strongest growth since Q4 2021. Nonresidential investment was revised higher to show a 1.3% rise instead of a 0.1% fall initially estimated, as the drop in equipment was shorter (-3.5% vs -3.8% in the advance estimate) and structures surged 6.9% (vs 1.6%). Also, residential investment rose for the first time in nearly two years and at a much faster pace than initially expected (6.2% vs 3.9% in the advance estimate). Meanwhile, private inventories added 1.4 pp to growth, above 1.32 pp in the previous estimate and government spending increased faster (5.5% vs 4.6%). On the other hand, consumer spending went up 3.6%, slightly less than 4% in the advance estimate, but remaining the biggest gain since Q4 2021. The slowdown was mainly due to services spending. Exports soared 6% (vs 6.2%) and imports increased less (5.2% vs 5.7%)."

You are a famous financial columnist who is beloved for your in-depth analysis of financial market and easy to understand writing style. Write a column focusing on the thesis of the passage below. Make sure to include the data provided in the passage to be more persuasive.

In a world of moderating inflation and slowing economic growth, I understand why it may be tempting for investors to assume that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will pivot quickly and ease its monetary policy. However, I believe that it is essential to resist this temptation, as the facts on the ground don’t suggest a Fed shift is imminent. Investors would be better served focusing on strategic positioning for an extended period of higher rates.

Labor market pushes back against Fed pivot case Inflation has undoubtedly peaked. Shelter was the primary contributor on the way up and is soon to drive further disinflation. Market data for rents and home prices had suggested a turnaround in shelter prices was coming soon, and the latest data for March finally showed the first slowdown in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for shelter since it started accelerating.

To be sure, we are nearing the end of the Fed’s hiking cycle. But disinflation alone is not enough to cause a swift pivot in policy, which is why it’s important to highlight the ongoing strengths in the labor market that may frustrate interest rate doves. Notably, wage growth has not eased to levels that are consistent with the Fed’s inflation targets. Initial jobless claims data are beginning to

[Europe] Living within planetary boundaries will require fundamental transitions in energy, food, mobility and urban systems, entailing profound changes in predominant institutions, practices, technologies, policies and lifestyles. New governance coalitions involving national and subnational levels of government, businesses and citizens are urgently needed.

[Europe] Positive long-term outlooks call for an urgent shift from incremental to transformational change in order to: decarbonize energy and transport systems and reduce other harmful emissions; restore ecosystems; decouple resource use, including material footprints, from overall economic performance; “green” public and private sector procurement; strengthen environmental responsibility in business; and incentivize lifestyle changes.

[Europe] Climate change is one of the largest threats to human and ecosystem health and to achieving sustainable development in the pan-European region. It is also an accelerator for most other environmental risks. Impacts of climate change affect health through floods, heat waves, droughts, reduced agricultural productivity, exacerbated air pollution and allergies and vector, food and water-borne diseases.

Summarise this text on 100 words: "Project Management Takes Time
Project management is known to be a time-consuming process, especially in the initial phases, where planning and preparation occur. As you can imagine, it takes time to identify project goals, develop a project plan, and allocate resources. This initial (or extra) time investment can be difficult for teams with limited resources, even though that investment often results in cost savings, improved efficiency, and better project outcomes and final products.
The Cost of Project Management
There are some instances where project management can be expensive, especially for smaller teams or small organizations. Project management not only costs time (which adds to personnel budgeting), but it also requires investment in things like project management software, training on project management tools, and other technical resources, which can quickly mount up. This can be a hurdle for small businesses that lack the financial resources to support a project management infrastructure, even though, again, those initial dollar investments are usually made up for by the money project management can save a company.
Lack of Flexibility
Project management, depending on the PM methodology, can be rigid and lack flexibility. Set timelines, budgets, and goals – and trying to keep to these “limitations” – can limit creativity and innovation and prevent teams from adapting to changing customer needs or changes in the marketplace. There are often cases where businesses need to be flexible and adapt to changing market conditions, which can be a challenge if you employ a rigid project management methodology or PM framework.
Project Management Is Complex
Project management is often a complicated process – an issue which grows worse the larger a project is. Businesses need to manage a multitude of tasks, resources, deadlines, and team members, which can leave project managers and stakeholders a bit overwhelmed. This complexity can also cause confusion and miscommunication, which, in turn, negatively affects project outcomes. Employing effective communication, collaboration tools, project management software, and stakeholder management can mitigate these challenges and help steer the project to a successful completion.
Reliance on Technology
Effective project management relies on a set of project management tools and software, which can be a burden for businesses with limited technology budgets. In addition to the cost of PM software, the organization may also need hardware, storage, cloud storage, and server equipment for their project as well. Likewise, team members will need to be proficient in using the technology and may require additional training to use it properly."

Generate a list of tags for the following text: Canada's Housing Minister Sean Fraser is evaluating a wide range of options as he looks to ease the housing crisis in the country, CBC reported on Sunday.

"There's a range (of incentives) that we're considering right now. Some could include potential tax incentives for builders to build. Some could include other low-cost financing arrangements," the report quoted Fraser as saying in an interview to CBC.

Fraser is also considering removing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on affordable housing projects and dedicating federal lands to rental housing, the report added.

Fraser told CBC that the main goals were to use funds previously allotted for existing programs more swiftly and effectively, guarantee Canada could use its construction workforce, and support relatively underdeveloped industries like factory-built homes.

Canada is facing a housing affordability crisis, which has been blamed on an increase in migrants and international students, fueling demand for homes just as rising costs have slowed construction.

The economy's unexpected contraction in the second quarter was largely due to declines in housing investment and smaller inventory accumulation as well as slower international exports and household spending.

 succinctly in 4 sentences,  how summarizing, analyzing and re-evaluating results with The analysis of results plays a crucial role in the expansion and improvement of programs across various fields, including education, business, healthcare, and technology. By systematically evaluating outcomes, organizations can gain insights that enable them to refine, scale, or adjust their initiatives for better performance and broader impact. Here’s how the process typically unfolds:

    Identifying Successes and Challenges: Analysis of results helps in pinpointing which aspects of a program are working well and which are not. This includes evaluating the effectiveness of strategies, interventions, and processes in achieving set goals.

    Data-Informed Decision Making: Through data analysis, organizations can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources, whether to expand certain aspects of a program, or to replicate successful models in other contexts or locations.

    Improving Efficiency: By understanding outcomes, organizations can streamline operations, reduce waste, and allocate resources more effectively. This might involve scaling up successful components of a program or discontinuing ineffective ones.

    Customization and Personalization: In contexts like education and healthcare, analysis of results can lead to more tailored approaches to meet individual needs. This can enhance the effectiveness of programs by addressing specific challenges or leveraging unique strengths.

    Innovation and Adaptation: Analyzing outcomes encourages innovation by highlighting gaps and opportunities. It can lead to the development of new strategies, technologies, or methodologies to improve program effectiveness.

    Evidence-Based Expansion: When programs are scaled or expanded based on solid evidence of their success and impact, there is a higher likelihood of achieving desired outcomes in new settings or with different populations.

    Stakeholder Engagement and Support: Sharing analysis results with stakeholders (including funders, participants, and the community) can build support for program expansion. Demonstrating evidence of impact is crucial for securing funding and gaining public or political support.

    Benchmarking and Goal Setting: Results analysis provides benchmarks for performance and helps in setting realistic, achievable goals for future phases of the program. This guides continuous improvement and helps measure progress over time.

    Regulatory Compliance and Accreditation: In some fields, demonstrating program effectiveness through data analysis is essential for regulatory compliance or accreditation. This can be a driving factor in program expansion and sustainability.

    Enhancing Reputation and Credibility: Programs that are able to demonstrate success through rigorous analysis can enhance their reputation and credibility. This, in turn, can attract more participants, funding, and partnerships, facilitating further expansion.

The cyclical process of analyzing results, implementing improvements, and scaling up successful elements ensures that programs remain dynamic, responsive, and impactful. This approach fosters a culture of continuous improvement and innovation, essential for addressing evolving challenges and needs. rolls up into expanding the program.

"The Euro Area posted a trade surplus of EUR 20.3 billion in November 2023, switching from a EUR 13.8 billion gap in the same month of the previous year. Imports tumbled by 16.7% to EUR 232.2 billion, while exports fell at softer 4.7% to EUR 252.5 billion.

Imports declined by 16.1% to EUR 2,327 billion, mainly due to a fall in energy products (-33.6%), raw materials (-22.9%) and machinery & vehicles (-1.3%). Exports remained relatively stable at EUR 2,352.5 billion, with increases in machinery & vehicles (+9.1%) counteracting declines in other manufactured goods (-2.8%) and chemicals (-4.9%).

There is a strange paradox in Marx’s approach to revolution. Generally speaking, when Marx speaks of material creativity, he speaks of “production”, and here he insists, as I’ve mentioned, that the defining feature of humanity is that we first imagine things, and then try to bring them into being. When he speaks of social creativity it is almost always in terms of revolution, but here, he insists that imagining something and then trying to bring it into being is precisely what we should never do. What if he was wrong as he did not take into account what we now know that youth are more creative, how could we codesign with youth a planetizen university to promote youth imagination to invent sustainable futures

Although Harvard is generally classified  as a private university, there is one sense in which it is quasi-public - it was founded by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, and the Massachusetts state constitution reserves to the state legislature (as the colonial legislature’s successor) the right to intervene in its governance, even though thus far that power has almost never been used. A purely private institution would not be a subject of government powers particular to it, even if those powers have gone unused.
Hello, I need assistance with a detailed calculation related to solar PV system integration into a residential electrical panel, and I'm looking for guidance that incorporates both NEC 705.12(D)(2) and the continuous load consideration. The scenario is this: I have a 200-amp main breaker and a 225-amp busbar. According to the NEC, the backfeed from a solar PV system to a panel is subject to the '120% rule', but there's also a need to consider a 125% factor for continuous load. The formula I'm working with is: Backfeed allowed ≤ ((120% of busbar rating) – Ampacity of the overcurrent protection device protecting the busbar) \/ 125%. Could you help me apply this formula to my scenario and explain the steps and reasoning behind each part of the calculation?

As of 2020, the US had $2.04 trillion in circulation. As much as half that value is estimated to be in circulation abroad, according to The Balance, an online journal.
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar rules. Around 90 per cent of forex trading involves the US dollar.
The dollar is just one of the world's 185 currencies according to International Standards Organisation List, but most of these currencies are only used inside their own countries, The Balance said.
Almost 40 per cent of the world's debt is issued in dollars. As a result, foreign banks need a lot of dollars to conduct business.
The Economist said one of the oddities of globalisation is that although America's trade footprint has shrunk, its monetary footprint has not. When the Fed changes course, trillions of dollars follow it around the world.
With the rise of some economies, Japan, Switzerland, the European Union, China, and Russia all tried several times to introduce their own currency as the reserve currency but failed.
Economists, businesses, traders, political leaders and experts said most of the people in the world still trust and have belief in the US treasury system and the US Federal Reserve for its global standard of ethics and smart management of the dollar and financial system.
As a result, many rising currencies could not be turned into reserve currency for other countries despite several attempts.
In March 2009, China and Russia called for a new global currency. China wanted its currency to be fully traded on the global foreign exchange markets.
In 1995, the Japanese yen and the Deutsche mark of Germany tried to take the place of the global reserve currency as the value of the two currencies were rising.

MISC Prospector
DEVELOPMENT HISTORY
The MISC Prospector is the most famous (and possibly most tortured) project to come out of MISC High Industrial’s infamous Project Cold Boot, an engineering team organized to develop additional revenue streams from existing MISC assets using limited resources. Development of the Prospector began in 2910 as an outgrowth of a review of the Freelancer light transport project. Having already seen success modifying the base Freelancer for both survey and fire suppression missions, MISC was keen to study even more unlikely uses for the chassis. To that end, MISC’s management reluctantly agreed to write off nine Freelancers which were transferred to the Cold Boot team. Three were complete and space tested, while the others were left in various stages of construction and shipped alongside their intended components.

The Cold Boot team began by spit-balling potential roles for a purpose-built Freelancer variant, which ranged from ordinary combat support drones to fire suppression spacecraft. From nearly three hundred rough concepts, the team voted to divide into three design groups to pursue more advanced physical development of the top three options. The first was a business oriented design dubbed the ‘Freeminder,’ which was to be a secure data relay ‘brain ship’. The second project opted to angle for a military contract with an armored space-to-ground reconnaissance vehicle called the Observer. The third, and considered the most unlikely to go forward, was to be
Correct the following text:The compact model of an integrated macro-financial system, which was proposed in the paper, has its behavior as being represented by dynamics of money, debt and wealth. Mutually contradictory integrity of these economic indicators had been noticed by Aristotle, and it was clearly manifested at the present stage of the global financialization, especially in the usage by central banks of the so called “deferred” assets accounts.
Macrofinancial assets, liabilities and real wealth were balanced in the model due appealing to the dual money attributes defined as a standard for either "deferred", or for current payments. The liquidity amounts that circulate between financial and real segments of the money market link the accumulation of genuine wealth with formation of a macrodebt representing the expected, i.e. unrealized, wealth. The volume of financial contracts was measured in the model by the system characteristic time that fixed the repayment dates of obligations. The wealth accumulation goes on the aggregated real market in a calendar time since the financial subsystem does not produce material goods. Money, debt and wealth dynamics were modeled by logistic ordinary differential equations, for which the solutions form three-dimensional surfaces of appropriate macrofinancial indices: total, financial and real wealth, as well as credit and the “marginal” wealth that were calculated under full repayment of obligations.
        The model was parametrized on empirical data and illustrated with numerical examples. The system behavior was studied for the given initial values of real resources, liquidity, rates of return and money issuance, as well as the average liability maturities. The model demonstrated that finance could multiply, indeed, the social wealth thus increasing efficiency of money transformation into capital (real resources). Excess liquidity on the financial market was appeared to be compatible with its deficit on the real segment of the money market, and vice versa. The surfaces intersection for the general and financial wealth indices corresponded to the state of  money "neutrality" occurring for the zero growth in real resources. Particular combinations of interest rates and money emission ratios could lead to deviations from a balanced trajectory thus generating various critical phenomena including those similar to resonance. Some negative consequences of the economy financialization could be evaluated via a “hump”  appearing on the surface of  long-term liabilities under som

Some final advice: Beware of cryptocurrencies and ratty CEOs like Musk
Allan Sloan
5–7 minuti

This is the time of year that you see lots of long, ambitious articles in newspapers, magazines and websites. That’s because editors and writers are eager to get their projects published by year-end so that they can submit them for this year’s journalism prizes.

It’s also the time of year that you see lots of journalists leaving their jobs and moving on to something new. This year, that includes me. This is my final regular Washington Post column. The Post has run my more-or-less weekly columns for about 30 years, the last seven of which — since I retired from Fortune — I’ve been a Post contractor. My current contract expires at year-end.

So before I go, I’d like to offer you some final words of advice and possibly give you a smile or two in the process.

Let’s start with Sam Bankman-Fried and cryptocurrency, which I called craptocurrency in a recent column.

I use that term because cryptocurrency is a bunch of crap. And it’s not a currency, which by definition is something that you can use to buy goods or services, and something that you get when you sell goods and services.

Retail investors who didn’t understand what they bought through Bankman-Fried’s FTX have learned the hard way that you can lose your shirt overnight with crypto, which is a speculative bet rather than a regulated currency like the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen or the Chinese renminbi.

Sure, central banks like the Federal Reserve haven’t exactly done a bang-up job the past couple of years, letting inflation and speculation get out of hand before tightening things this year, possibly excessively. But I’d rather rely on Fed Chair Jay Powell to serve my interests than to depend on the likes of Bankman-Fried — I can’t help but smile at the “bank” part of his name — to treat people honestly.

I’m a recovering English major who’s learned about business on the job and never studied finance. (I was a straight-A student in economics — but I took only one course.) Possibly because I lack academic training, I try to see — and explain to you — how the financial world actually works, as opposed to the way financial theory says the financial world should work. That’s why it took me about 12 seconds to see that cryptocurrency is a crapshoot, not a currency.

I wish that I’d paid attention to Bankman-Fried and his fellow travelers before FTX failed and cost retail investors who’d fallen for his nonsense a lot of money.

I don’t know how many of you would have taken my advice if I’d warned you before the FTX flopperoo. But just as I like to think that I may have encouraged some people to get lifesaving cardiac surgery by writing earlier this year about my new aortic valve, I might have helped some of you avoid being snookered by the crypto crowd.

Speaking of advice, I’d sure stay away from anything run by Elon Musk or associated with him. Yes, early Tesla investors who bought Tesla when its stock was in double digits before its big run-up two years ago are way ahead and Musk deserves credit for building Tesla into a credible company. But that was then, and this is now. When last I looked, Tesla had tanked by more than two-thirds from its Jan. 3 high of $399.93 a share. One reason, of course, is that Musk has sold tons of Tesla shares to raise money to deal with his personal financial situation.

It's clear from watching Musk’s antics at Twitter that he seems to have an endless need for self-promotion and publicity. There may be a method to Musk’s seeming madness. But I don’t have the patience — or a strong enough stomach — to wait Musk out.

I get a kick out of imagining that one of these days, Musk will buy the company that owns the Truth Social network used by Donald Trump. That way, Musk can shovel some money to Trump and perhaps lure Trump and his followers back into Twitter, either directly or indirectly. Maybe that would help shore up Twitter’s finances, such as they are.

Now, I’ll do what I should do, and stop while I’m ahead. Or maybe only a little behind.

I’d like to thank The Post for buying my column when I self-syndicated it — revenue from The Post and various other outlets is how my wife and I paid for our kids’ college educations without them or us having to take on debt. And I’m glad to have kept up my relationship with The Post for so long.

I’d like to thank those of you who’ve read my Post columns over the years. I’d especially like to thank those of you who’ve told me that my columns helped you understand the financial world. That’s what I try to do — and it’s why I’m pleased and flattered when people tell me that I’ve been successful.

Meanwhile, if you’ve got an hour or so, you can look at this video of my recent conversation with my friend Andy Serwer when I was named a Business News Legend last month by SABEW, the nation’s biggest trade association of business journalists.

Thanks to Andy’s skillful questioning, that video shows how I think about things and what I’ve done over my 50-plus-year business-writing career. You may find it helpful. Or even interesting.

I wish you well. I also wish The Washington Post well as it navigates a tough climate. And who knows? One of these days, when I’ve finished sorting through the options for the next stage of my career, you may occasionally see my byline in The Post business or opinion section.

Be well, stay safe. And thanks for reading me.

Who is Scrum Master?

For musicians, it is a drummer in a rock band, 
he makes everyone understand the the rhythm,
clearly marks ending of song parts.
Every musician has his part to play, 
drummer gaves it a steady progress feeling.
Similar to drummer, Scrum Master measures time, 
timeboxes activities and actors, gives basic rules for everyone.

Scrum should feel rhythm of Tight-Loose-Tigh management, which simplified means
that Management is not micromanaging the team during whole iteration but lets them 
self-manage as much as possible, providing support. This allows 
all to add unique value to the process.

For positive psychologists, it is the man who is
helping the team (including management) enter a flow state,
by helping to create psychologically safe space,
reducing unnecesarry stress and distractions,
so team can stay focused on effort to produce value flow for users\/customers.

Scrum Master works on Team development. In very similar style to how 
Personal development works, but focused primarilly on the team, helping them 
to achieve goals together in effective manner, to learn from mistakes in past
and to become more and more self-managed.

For Product Owner, it is the one that helps to estimate 
how much work can the team probably do during next product increment, 
who helps to refine backlog by splitting large goals into smaller ones 
in a best way (SMART, INVEST, WSJB, ...), who helps to measure and visualize progress and risks, problems,
who will ask for support when team will need it to overcome impediments blocking progress.

Scrum Master will face problems that no one could solve and 
also angry people who will need to get some answers. 

His goal is not to solve every problem, 
but he is there to help others express what needs to be said, 
allowing everyone to participate in making the teamwork better.
He makes planning and results more predictable and reliable.

Why the capitalist view of rewarding success with extra material wealth, always leads to punishing hard work for the majority

I once saw a video regarding how hard it would be to become a billionaire through manual work and a normal wage. Thousands of years. Then, one of the commentators came with an interesting argument. In a reply to a comment questioning why people just doesn't work as hard as a billionaire if they want to become rich, the reply was something like this "A economy where everyone is a successful and hardowrking entrepreneur, doesn't sound very sustainable. Everyone would be too rich and consume too much"

To me, this illustrated the glaring contradiction in not necessarily only capitalism, but generally just the idea that hard work is rewarded with more wealth. It is mathematically impossible for this to be true, and by definition, the view that hard work rewards much extra material wealth, needs to punish hard work for the majority who works hard.

Here is the widely accepted premise: People who work hard and take risks, deserves to be awarded extra material wealth which the economy could not bear to give everyone. This motivates economically productive work for those with talent and drive, and gives less reward to those who do not produce much value, and therefore would destroy the economy if they too were granted the same luxuries.

Out of these people who work hard, there would be two different types. The manual laborer who may build a chair 10x faster than theirs peers, and the successful economic planner who operates a business and orders people to do stuff in a way that generated lots of income.

As for the hard working chair maker, it is easier to defend the idea of extra reward in accordance to productivity, provided the means to do this is held in common and equal access to all. Or perhaps we must realize that all we have is the result of millions of people dying and laboring, mostly uncredited, and that measuring each contribution is an act of futility. This is the age old debate between the worker being rewarded the product of their labor, or the product of their labor being held in common as well. As for this, the jury is still up.

For the successful economic planner to exist however, it always entails someone who is subordinate, and someone who rules. Even if all of humanity worked equally hard to earn enough money to employ some workers, and then have those workers do activity which generates revenue, it is mathematically impossible for more than a handful of those to succeed and be able to employ many workers which generate value, since it assumes one economic planner and then the worker bees. Meaning, no matter how you work for that "entrepreneurial grindset", most likely you are going to fail, and to a large extent, what happens is reliant on luck. 

I ask then, by what merit does the economic planner have to justify the wealth to purchase a Ferrari, when everyone works hard to try and achieve this wealth, and mathematically only a few can succeed? Yes they worked hard, but so did the others. Is it luck then, which justifies it? If so, are you not just punishing those who worked hard by being a central economic planner in the first place? A fairer solution would be: workers realize that the entrepreneurial mindset is a curse which always causes one minority to rule a minority, because this is the very foundation of it's functioning. Workers then form participatory organizations where the employer\/employee distinction is blurred. We don't make fetish of leaders or masters, because this dooms us in a cycle where inequality is mathematically needed, and hard work is mathematically punished in a ruthless game of dice.

Please humanize the following: Socialism and communism emerged as responses to the inequalities and harsh conditions brought about by capitalist industrialization. As industrialization progressed, capitalist owners amassed wealth while workers endured poor wages, long hours, and unsafe working conditions. Socialists advocated for public ownership of resources and collective control over production to ensure fair distribution of wealth and improve working conditions. Communists, inspired by Marx's ideas, envisioned a classless society where the government owned the means of production and wealth was distributed equally among citizens. In contrast, capitalism relies on private ownership of resources, free market competition, and individual decision-making by business owners to drive economic activity. Socialism, on the other hand, involves either government or collective ownership of resources, with wealth distributed more evenly among the population.

This is the index’s 16th negative reading in the past 18 months. The index for new orders declined 3 points to 1.3, while the current shipments index more than offset its increase last month, dropping sharply from 10.8 to -17.9. Firms reported mostly steady levels of employment, with the employment index falling 3 points to 0.8 in November. The prices paid diffusion index declined from 23.1 in October to 14.8 in November and the current prices received index was little changed at 14.8. The future indicators suggest that firms’ expectations for growth over the next six months remain subdued."

"The ISM Manufacturing PMI was unchanged at 46.7 in November 2023, the same as in October, and below forecasts of 47.6, continuing to point to contraction in the manufacturing sector. Companies are still managing outputs appropriately as order softness continues. Production moved to contraction (48.5 vs 50.4) and employment (45.8 vs 46.8) fell more while the Supplier Deliveries Index indicated faster deliveries for the 14th straight month (46.2 vs 47.7). Meanwhile, new orders (48.3 vs 45.5) and inventories (44.8 vs 43.3) shrank at a slower pace and prices fell less (49.9 vs 45.1), signifying price stability as a result of energy markets easing, though offset by increases in the steel markets. Still, manufacturing supplier lead times continue to decrease, a positive for future economic activity."

Summarise this text:  It is essential for the actuary to understand how an insurer accounts for premiums and
claims arising from outwards reinsurance. Unfortunately different insurers often adopt
different conventions when accounting for outwards reinsurance. This section describes
a number of the key issues which the actuary should consider.
2. Many excess of loss reinsurance policies specify the exchange rate (the 'slip rate') to be
used in calculating the maximum recovery which can be made. This rate is almost
always different, often significantly so, from the rate which is used to produce claims and
premium data and accounts. Also, the slip rates may be different for different layers of
the same programme or for different programmes (e.g. marine versus non-marine). The
gross individual claims need to be recalculated at the slip rates before they can be
applied to the reinsurance programme. For estimation purposes, the projected ultimate
amounts for these individual claims may also need to be calculated at the slip rates if
distortion is to be avoided, though the actuary may be satisfied that any distortion will not
be material after having made investigations.
3. When estimating an insurer's outwards reinsurance recoveries, it is important to take into
account any reinstatement premiums payable, together with possible recoveries from
reinstatement premium protections. Credit should not be taken for any part of the
reinsurance programme which has been commuted and the effect of inwards
commutations on reinsurance recoveries will need to be considered carefully both at the
time of the commutation and in subsequent reserving exercises.

translate each paragraph to chinese and make the chinese text underneath of each one: The global financial landscape has undergone a significant transformation, expanding to include a variety of asset classes beyond the traditional realms of currencies and stocks.&nbsp;​This evolution is a testament to the importance of economic interdependence, which necessitates fair and efficient global markets. These markets are crucial for real-time price discovery, effective hedging, and allowing for diverse speculation.​One of the newer asset classes to emerge is cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, which have introduced a novel digital store of value and a means of exchange. However, their volatility and practical applications are still in the process of maturing. Alongside these digital assets, foreign exchange trading of major and emerging market currencies continues to be a substantial global market—fueled by the increased cross-border capital flows and trade. Exchange rates play a critical role in international trade and investment, affecting economies at large.Commodities, including oil, gold, and agricultural goods, are also significant assets on the global trading stage. Their prices not only influence industries but are also a determinant of inflation rates. Additionally, geopolitical events can have substantial effects on these commodity markets.Investors seeking exposure to broad segments of the global economy can turn to market indexes that track major stock exchanges. Furthermore, sector\/industry Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) offer targeted investments in specific industries, while asset-specific ETFs have proliferated, allowing passive investment across various niches from real estate to bonds.Understanding this diverse investment landscape is paramount. The investment opportunity set has widened considerably, reaching beyond any single country or asset class. Globalization and financial innovation have paved the way for new investment frontiers but have also introduced complexity. Investors must navigate various risk\/return tradeoffs across multiple liquid investment vehicles worldwide.Given the intricacies of economic interdependence and the risks associated with lack of policy transparency and clarity,&nbsp;&nbsp;de-coupling, capital restrictions, tax complexities, ...,&nbsp;and, conflicts\/wars, it's imperative for countries and businesses to focus on hedging against different types of risks in the global marketplace. Effective risk management strategies, diversified trade relationships, and resilience are all critical in mitigating potential vulnerabilities amidst economic uncertainties. This balanced approach embraces the interconnected nature of the global economy while striving to manage and reduce risks to foster stability and sustainability.​To navigate the complexities of the global economic landscape with confidence, it is essential to manage financial risks wisely while investing or not.The future is BitBull.trade—a platform where you can engage in Banking &amp; Trading globally [See&nbsp;BitBull - Global Bank &amp; Trading Exchange] to take control of your investments and financial strategies in an ever-changing world.

"The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.46% to close at 2,730 while the Shenzhen Component tumbled 2.24% to 8,056 on Friday, hitting their lowest levels in about four years as economic uncertainties continued to weigh on investor sentiment. Earlier this week, official data showed that Chinese manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in January, while a private survey pointed to a third straight month of expansion in the sector. A series of stimulus measures from Beijing also failed to sustain a recovery in Chinese stocks amid pressure from Evergrande’s liquidation and fears of a wider US ban on Chinese entities. Growth stocks led the decline, with sharp losses from Contemporary Amperex (-2%), Wuxi Apptec (-10%), Zhongji Innolight (-1.1%), East Money Information (-1.9%) and iFLYTEK (-2.7%). The Shanghai and Shenzhen indexes lost 6.2% and 8.1%, respectively, this week."

MapleStory developer Nexon is being hit with a sizable fine by the Korean Fair Trade Commission over what the body says are deceptive loot box practices.

As reported by the Korean Times and Business Korea, Nexon is being fined some $8.85 million (about 11.6 billion won) for allegedly lowering the probabilities of some loot box items capable of upgrading player equipment,, known as Cubes, without telling players According to the Korean Times, it is the largest fine of this type levied to date.


Nexon is being fined nearly $9 million for what is being called deceptive loot box practices.
NEXON IS BEING FINED NEARLY $9 MILLION FOR WHAT IS BEING CALLED DECEPTIVE LOOT BOX PRACTICES.
The judgment claims that Nexon engaged in these practices for more than 10 years in a period dating back to 2010, including secretly lowering the loot box odds for some items to near zero. The findings were reportedly based on internal documents obtained from Nexon.

"Nexon made announcements about changes to the games hundreds of times from 2010-21, but it omitted the information about the probability adjustment," the KTFC said in a statement. It added, "Our judgment is that the company had aimed to lure customers by giving them false information and used deceptive means."

Loot boxes have become less popular in recent years owing to the intense backlash from fans. Instead, developers are more likely to favor the battle pass model pioneered by the likes of Dota 2 and Fortnite. However, loot boxes remain prevalent in mobile games and sports games, and they are a hot button issue for regulators.

Nexon in particular has become known for its aggressive monetization practices. Last year, IGN reported on MapleStory's controversial "New Age" update, which made it more difficult for players in certain regions to farm a key currency while the price of some items were inflated. The update led to large-scale protests throughout the community.

Our judgment is that [Nexon] had aimed to lure customers by giving them false information and used deceptive means
“
MapleStory is a free-to-play 2D MMO that first launched back in 2003. It has purportedly raked in some $418 million [550 billion won] in sales from its loot boxes in the period between 2010 and 2021.

The Korean Times reports that Nexon apologized in its statement but that it will appeal the decision. IGN has reached out to Nexon representatives for a full statement.

"**Role:** Business Analyst\/Strategy Consultant\/Corporate Researcher

**Objective:** Carry out an exhaustive examination of two provided company descriptions and determine the nature of their competitive relationship. This relationship should fit into one of the following six categories:

- **Direct Competitors**: Entities operating within the same industry sector and at an identical stage of the industry life cycle, providing virtually identical, if not indistinguishable, goods or services. They target the same customer demographics within identical geographic markets. Their business models mirror each other, often reflecting similar organizational culture and values, and resulting in comparable value propositions and marketing strategies. These competitors vie for the same market share, using similar distribution channels and technological advancements. For example, McDonald's and Burger King are direct competitors, as they battle for market dominance within the same geographical boundaries.

- **Partial Competitors**: These companies operate within the same industry or similar industries but directly compete only in specific aspects of their business, such as certain product lines or services. While they may share some target customer demographics and geographic markets, the competition is not all-encompassing. A multinational tech firm producing a broad array of electronics, for example, might be a partial competitor with a niche tech company, competing directly only in the laptop market.

- **Indirect Competitors**: These businesses belong to the same industry or cater to similar customer demographics, but diverge significantly in their product or service offerings. This divergence could stem from different stages of the industry life cycle, disruptive innovations, or unique value propositions. For instance, a local farmers' market and a multinational supermarket are indirect competitors, as they both vend food products but differ markedly in scale, customer preferences, and value propositions.

- **Emerging Competitors**: These businesses, while not currently direct competitors, harbor the potential to transform into formidable rivals due to strategic changes, innovation, or market shifts. A technology startup developing a ground-breaking product or service that could disrupt existing market norms represents an example of an emerging competitor.

- **Complementary Companies**: These entities operate within the same industry ecosystem or supply chain, offering distinct and often synergistic products or service
