Act as a software engineer expert and implement a tic tac toe game based on the following:
```
**Requirements:**

1. The game should be a console-based application.
2. The game should be a two-player game (Player X and Player O).
3. The game board should be a 3x3 grid.
4. Players will take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the grid.
5. The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.
6. If all spots on the board are filled and no player has 3 symbols in a row, the game is a draw.
7. The game should be able to validate the input and show an error message if the input is invalid (e.g., a player tries to place their symbol in a spot that is already filled).
8. The game should display the board after each turn so players can see the current state of the game.
9. The game should announce the winner (or a draw) when the game ends.

**Actionable Plan:**

1. **Design the game board:** This will be a 3x3 grid, which can be represented as a 2D array.

2. **Implement the game loop:** This is the main part of the game where players take turns to make a move. The game continues until there is a winner or the board is full.

3. **Handle player input:** When it's a player's turn, the game should prompt them for their move. The game should check if the input is valid (i.e., the chosen spot is within the board and is not already filled). If the input is invalid, the game should prompt the player to try again.

4. **Check for game over conditions:** After each turn, the game should check if there is a winner or if the board is full. If the game is over, the game should announce the result (who the winner is or if it's a draw).

5. **Display the board:** The game should have a function to print the current state of the board. This function should be called after each turn so players can see the result of their move.

6. **Test the game:** Play several rounds of the game to make sure everything works as expected. Check that the game handles invalid input correctly, that it correctly identifies the winner (or a draw), and that the board is displayed correctly after each move.

7. **Refactor and optimize the code:** Once the basic game is working, look for ways to make the code cleaner and more efficient.

8. **Document the code:** Add comments to the code explaining what each part does. This will make it easier for others (or future you) to understand how the game works.

This is a high-level plan and might need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project. But it should give you a good starting point for developing your tic-tac-toe game.  ``` now reply directly with code implementation.

summarize this text: Trainer Saffie Joseph Jr has been suspended after two of his horses died in the lead-up to Saturday's 149th Kentucky Derby.

Parents Pride and Chasing Artie collapsed and died at the Churchill Downs track, with the cause of death still unknown.

Another of Joseph Jr's horses, Lord Miles, has been scratched from the race following his suspension.

Four horses have now died in the build-up to America's most celebrated race.

The suspension prohibits Joseph Jr, or any trainer directly or indirectly employed by him, from entering horses in races or applying for stall occupancy at all Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) owned racetracks.

"Given the unexplained sudden deaths, we have reasonable concerns about the condition of his horses and decided to suspend him indefinitely until details are analysed and understood," said Bill Mudd, the CDI president and chief operating officer.

"The safety of our equine and human athletes and integrity of our sport is our highest priority. We feel these measures are our duty and responsibility."

Take Charge Briana and Wild On Ice, trained by Wayne Lukas and Joel Marr respectively, both had to be put down down after suffering leg injuries at the track in Louisville earlier this week.

CDI says it is working with regulators to investigate the circumstances behind the deaths.

An earlier CDI statement prior to Joseph Jr's suspension described the deaths as "completely unacceptable" and that "these troubling incidents are alarming and must be addressed."

Extract the pros and cons from the following boardgame review as two lists of bullet points:

"Ask me if I like Magic the Gathering (MtG) and I’ll say, “of course.” But ask me if I like playing Magic the Gathering and I’ll say: “absolutely not.”

I like the idea of MtG. I appreciate the game’s design, mechanics, innovation, and the way it became a Lisztomania (or Beatlemania or NKOTB-mania or BTS-mania) phenomenon for the board game industry. As Ash in Alien once said: “I admire its purity.” But I’ll never say yes to a game of Magic for a 60-card deck of reasons.

Unlike mana, time and money are not renewable resources. I don’t have the 10,000 hours to become skilled at it. I don’t have the discretionary income for a lifetime subscription that funds endless new sets and boosters – let alone go on spendy, quixotic quests to acquire four copies of That One Card™ to make my deck bulletproof.

MtG has also proliferated and far outgrown its borders such that the edge cases have edge cases, the exceptions have exceptions, and the explainers need explainers. I don’t have the endurance to clear the rising bar of technical chauvinism required to learn MtG’s meta lingo and decode umpteen blog takes and strategy guides that read like Klingon phrase books to a casual player.

The primary reason I avoid Magic is the existential dread I feel when I think about it. I think of the 20,000+ unique cards that have been created for MtG over its lifespan and the unfathomable number of 60-card deck permutations one can create from that population, and my soul deflates and says “why even bother?” I wouldn’t know where or when to start. I’m someone that needs more signposts and structure. I’m not Dr. Strange cycling through Endgame scenarios so can’t reach the edge of MtG’s known universe in this lifetime to find the walls, ceiling, and floor. I would break out in Gatorade sweats well before I tap my first card at the table.

I know that this a “me” problem and not a MtG problem. My eyes are wide open: as a casual player it’s far too late for Magic and me. I was left behind decades ago. But I still thank Valki, God of Lies and give credit to designer Bruce Glassco for his Kennerspiel-nominated title Fantasy Realms (released by WizKids). It’s the first card game that isn’t Magic but that gives me a taste of Magic, and makes clear what I do love about (never having to play) Magic.

Fantasy Realms emits big anti-Magic energy upon first blush. It’s a non-skirmish, non-collectible card game with a deck of 53 cards. You are not a powerful wizard swirling spells, but instead a ruler aiming to build the most powerful coalition from five suits of fantasy-themed people, places, and things. Each card is mechanically unique and exists only in a single copy. There are wizards and royalty. There are beasts. There are land types (with far more interesting things to do than in MtG). There are weapons. There are artifacts. There are forces of nature. Seven of these cards, after about 10 minutes of card swapping gameplay, will comprise your entire world and determine victory.

Unlike MtG there are no attack or defense cards. There are no instants, interrupts, or continuing in-game card effects. The deck is 100% end-of-game scoring cards. Each card is assigned a 0-40 point value and bonus or penalty if certain conditions on the card are met, or not met. Boom or bust conditions depend on the combination of the final seven cards in your hand at game’s end. Some card combos are utter soulmates (netting you positive points) and some cards can’t stand to be in the same room as one another so negate each other or give additional negative points.

Players start with seven cards. Turns consist of a “one in, one out” forced draft and swap. Each turn you must draw a card and discard a card, keeping your hand limit to seven. Discards are placed on the table in a face-up spread available for any player to take during their turn instead of a (random) deck draw. This includes you if you want to try to retrieve your own discard later and it’s still there when your turn comes back around. (You most definitely experience and suffer from discarder’s remorse in a game of Fantasy Realms).

The face-up discard buffet is also the game’s clever timer; when the 10th discard is placed face up on the table, the game immediately ends and the seven cards players are holding determine final scores.

I love Fantasy Realms. It cuts to the chase, and often cuts to the quick. The game is a race car stripped down to the essentials and built for speedy fun. Yet these speed runs teem with player interaction and a crunchy, 4D decision space. Choices are teeth-grindingly tight and tense. Your seven-card hand is a full, tiny lifeboat; you can’t save them all. So which card is expendable each turn? Tossing one into the face-up flotsam of on the table is nerve-wracking and comes with a high wince factor when opponents are all too eager to scoop up the card you just agonized over giving up. Possible insult to injury often occurs if you later see a left-for-dead card’s comboriffic soulmate that your opponent bingos or that is too late in the game for you to rescue from the trash heap.

Fantasy Realms is ultra-tactical as you change your card swap priorities and set collecting strategies on the fly. “Take backsies” are common when you reevaluate the perfect 7 you wish to keep, or flip-flop on a card you tossed earlier. And the discard economy is a teeter-tottering trolley problem: extend the game by not drawing from the top of the deck, which will add another click to the 10-card endgame timer? Or fast-forward to the end by top-decking and triggering the 10-discard endgame as soon as possible? Games are so quick that there’s no regrets even if you fail to collect that 4-card “Bell, Book & Candle” power combo that guarantees at least 150+ points.

And as for the existential, “why bother” sweats I get ruminating over Magic: while 53 cards does not a micro card game make, Fantasy Realms sure feels like a micro game when side-by-side with MtG. It’s Magic: The Gathering in haiku form. A dynamic distillation of the ideas in MtG that feels like a one-act, ten-minute play.

I love that Fantasy Realms is not a deckbuilder but a handbuilder. It’s true hand management from a shared, finite, knowable population of cards. It’s easier to grok the percentages and risk the odds to collect That One Card™ when there are only 53; there’s never a need to page Dr. Strange to run the numbers for you.

I love that in Fantasy Realms there is no deck engine to build, no grinding metagame to go get that card that hits the jackpot. You’ll press your luck and hope you see those combos. And you’ll either see them or you won’t. New game. Since cards combo for endgame scoring only there are no in-game shenanigans. And the 50+ unique endgame scoring prerequisites is crystal clear. There are no edge cases requiring adjudication or a podcast to suss out.

I especially love that there isn’t direct conflict in Fantasy Realms. Players collect cards to build something: a coalition, an ideal army, the best equipped fortress. Fantasy Realms feels like a prequel to Magic standard game narrative. In Fantasy Realms the story ends before the onslaught of head to head conflict takes place. As well as the deck fishing and deck emptying iffy combos with soon-to-be banned cards (things that I have an allergic reaction to when gaming).

[Ed: Thinking about Limited Magic, Fantasy Realms captures the interaction that comes from reading signals and trying to divine what your opponents are drafting.]

The crux of my Fantasy Realms admiration is that it restores the agency back to the players at the table. MtG matches and tournaments boil down to their metagaming abstractions: two decks playing themselves, with the players literal avatars, subsumed by their own constructed decks. Good players do possess skill and expertise, and the usual suspects are always at the top of the rankings. But at its most pessimistic, MtG players are always second billing; afterthoughts to the currency and value of their cards. Like Dr. Frankenstein, eclipsed by their own (monstrous) creations.

The apocryphal story behind the origin of Magic: The Gathering was that Wizards of the Coast wanted Richard Garfield to create a game that was portable, with minimal components, that could be played by people waiting in line at game conventions. MtG didn’t quite achieve that goal. (My friend joked “that’s because for MtG you still need a table to flip for when you lose.”) But Fantasy Realms gets closer to that simpler, lofty ideal.

And while Fantasy Realms isn’t a MtG killer, and while it may never compare to an 18-card experience like (say) Love Letter, Fantasy Realms is a metaphorical love letter to Magic. And it’s alchemy: a bottled essence that helped me remember what I liked when building and playing those nascent Magic decks decades ago. Before 20,000 cards were created, with an endless pipeline of more to come. Before power creep. Before banned cards. Before the digital age. Before the slap-fight ethics of netdecking. Before the CCG bubble, and before the Wizards of the Coast realized that the secondary market of trading and buying cards was hugely important (at times more important) than the game itself. Before setting your watch to the Next Big Deck, always tournament-ready and programmed to within an inch of its life and as soulless as an infinite loop you programmed in BASIC on the Commodore 64.

Fantasy Realms reminded me of the initial feeling of enchantment and excitement I felt experiencing a wholly new game system that transported me to a new world and told a wondrous story. Back when I had 1st generation naivete and took for granted that when playing MtG I’d be more invested in my friends at the table and the social experience than with the rules and cards themselves. Unlike my least favorite bits of Magic the Gathering, Fantasy Realms is a card game that can remain untroubled and unconcerned with which decks win or which decks lose.

Act as a software engineer expert and implement a tic tac toe game based on the following:
```
**Requirements:**

1. The game should be a console-based application.
2. The game should be a two-player game (Player X and Player O).
3. The game board should be a 3x3 grid.
4. Players will take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the grid.
5. The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.
6. If all spots on the board are filled and no player has 3 symbols in a row, the game is a draw.
7. The game should be able to validate the input and show an error message if the input is invalid (e.g., a player tries to place their symbol in a spot that is already filled).
8. The game should display the board after each turn so players can see the current state of the game.
9. The game should announce the winner (or a draw) when the game ends. ``` now reply directly with code python implementation. 
Can you give me a short lesson to help me play against 1.d4 in chess?  I'm rated 1600, but I am clueless against the Queen's Gambit and the London System.

When the position is open, I can usually create targets and tactics, but in closed positions, I just shuffle my pieces around and eventually lose.

Sokoban is one of the most popular thought and logic games.  
As simple as that name is, so is the idea of this game: A level represents a store room, where boxes to be placed. You move the warehouse keeper(player) to push the boxes around the maze of the room so that, at the end, all boxes are on goal squres. The only restrictions are that the warehouse keeper can only push a box, never pull, and that just one box may be pushed at a time.

The following table shows each element of sokoban's level as a character.

| Level element      | Character | ASCII Code |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Wall               | #         | 0x23       |
| Player             | @         | 0x40       |
| Box                | $         | 0x24       |
| Goal square        | .         | 0x2e       |
| Box on goal square | *         | 0x2a       |
| Floor              | (Space)   | 0x20       |

A level must contain a player.  
A level must have as many goal squares as there are boxes.

The simplest solvable level looks like this:

I charge forward in a race, fueled by the thrill of the chase. I overtake the one in third place with grace, but before I can claim my space, I'm surpassed by another eager face. I push on with tenacity, not willing to accept this new pace, and manage to reclaim my advance, stepping ahead even of the one who was once in second place. Now, with these shifts in the race's embrace, tell me, in what new position do I find myself with haste?

You are an expert in chess and familiar with all the rules of the standard game. You are an expert in the strategies including openings, middle games, and endgame. You will carefully analyze the following game, which is described in standard chess notation, and consider carefully all aspects of play. Pay attention to chess rules, ensuring pieces are located at legal positions (e.g., pawns cannot move backwards) and that both white and black have possible legal moves (e.g., avoiding stalemate). Any descriptions of moves must be legal for the directions and number of squares that piece is able to move. If the current position has resulted in statemate or checkmate, consider if there was a better move that the player could have made to avoid this result. Suggest the best strategic next moves. Consider whether pawns might have been promoted or whether the game board description might be incorrect.

White pieces:
d4, h2, Ka3, Qe7, Qf7
Black pieces:

Question: which country had the most cyclists finish within the top 10?

Please provide the final answer in |answer| |\/answer|
I'm standing at the South Pole. Give me walking directions to a cool mountain.
```
EEEEEEEEE
MEHEEHEPE
EEEEEEEEE
```

M - you start here on this exact cell
P - your target, you have to end next to it (not diagonally but horizontally or vertically next to it)
E - empty cell, walkable
H - hole (avoid), cannot stand on it, cannot walk on it, cannot teleport onto it

* teleportation does not use movement points, as these are separate
* it is more important to use movement points, but teleportation is inevitable to reach the target
* you have teleportation spells that allow you to advance by exactly 2 cells 
* you can teleport over holes but not into them. 
* You also have 5 movement points that you can advance over E cells, while avoiding holes. 
* you can only mutate the map by changing the position of "M"

{System}You are an rpg dungeon player. Your task is to choose the right path and not die. You have 100 power points. You can fight monsters that have fewer power points than you, or you will die.

Example of a move:
{System} Move 34:
1. Go upstairs. The door is closed.
2. Go to the left. The monster has 50 points.
3. Go down. Chest.
{Player} I choose 3. I chose to go down because there is a chest there and there may be a valuable thing there
{The game begins!!!}
Move 1:

This is a script to generate game tree for the tic-tac-toe game. Player plays with "X", bot plays with "O". The bot moves here are rational, following a strategy to aim for victory:
```python
def check_winner(board):
    winning_positions = [
        [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8],  # Rows
        [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8],  # Columns
        [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]  # Diagonals
    ]
    
    for positions in winning_positions:
        if board[positions[0]] == board[positions[1]] == board[positions[2]] != '-':
            return board[positions[0]]
    
    return None


def generate_board_states(board, depth, current_player):
    if depth == 0 or check_winner(board) is not None:
        return f'<li>{board}<\/li>'
    
    states = []
    for i, cell in enumerate(board):
        if cell == '-':
            new_board = list(board)
            new_board[i] = current_player
            next_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'
            child_states = generate_board_states(new_board, depth - 1, next_player)
            states.append(f'<li>{board}<ul>{child_states}<\/ul><\/li>')
    
    return ''.join(states)


def generate_html_game_tree():
    root_board = '---------'
    max_depth = 9
    current_player = 'X'
    
    html = f'<ul>{generate_board_states(root_board, max_depth, current_player)}<\/ul>'
    return f'<html><body>{html}<\/body><\/html>'


# Generate the HTML game tree and save it to a file
html_game_tree = generate_html_game_tree()

with open('game_tree.html', 'w') as file:
    file.write(html_game_tree)
```
Rewrite script.
Player uses "X" always, and instead of using `ul` and `li` tags for nesting there should be radio buttons with id attributes having values like "s-xo------" there "s" is a prefix to fulfil requirements on attribute naming ("s" for "state") and other 9 symbols determine the current state of the board for the player and opponent. The player by clicking the radio will choose his and opponent's move in the same time, so player not only put "X" but a combination of "X" and "O" for each turn. Instead of formal nesting each checked radio should make the corresponding div element visible like so:
```
<style>
#sxo-------:checked ~ .sxo-------{ display: block;}
<\/style>
```
These are the rules for the init state of the board:
```
<style>
div {display: none;}
.s {display: block;}
<\/style>
```
So, the key is that instead of normal nesting there should be logical nesting using class sequence: user sets the radio and all corresponding divs become visible:
```
<style>
div {display: none;}
#sxo-------:checked ~ .sxo-------{ display: block;}
<\/style>
```

Ensure that:
1) The generated output should contain attribute values as follows:
class="sxo-------" instead of class="s['X', 'O', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']" and so on for all the rest and ensure symbols are in lower case;
2) The same rule for id attributes
3) The generated output should contain intermediate player-opponent moves:
```
<div class="s---------">
<input name="state" id="sxo-------" type="radio"\/>
<label for="sxo-------">xo-------<\/label>
<input name="state" id="sx-o------" type="radio"\/>
<label for="sx-o------">x-o------<\/label>
<input name="state" id="sx--o-----" type="radio"\/>
<label for="sx--o-----">x--o-----<\/label>
...
<input name="state" id="sx-------o" type="radio"\/>
<label for="sx-------o">x-------o<\/label>
...
<input name="state" id="s-------xo" type="radio"\/>
<label for="s-------xo">-------xo<\/label>
<\/div>
<div class="sxo-------">
<input name="state" id="sxo-x--o--" type="radio"\/>
<label for="sxo-x--o--">sxo-x--o--<\/label>
...
<\/div>
...
<div class="sxo-x--o--">
...
<input name="state" id="sxo-xxoo--" type="radio"\/>
<label for="sxo-xxoo--">sxo-xxoo--<\/label>
...
<\/div>
...
```
(`div` tags with classes from this example should exist in the generated output)
4) The initial state of the board should be like this:
```
<style>
    .sxo-------,
    .sx-o------,
    .sx--o-----,
    .sx---o----,

While this card is on the field, its Level becomes 4. This card gains the following effects depending on its current Level on the field. ● Level 3 or higher: If you control another "0x3759" monster, this card cannot be chosen as an attack target. Additionally, after this card inflicts battle damage to your opponent by a direct attack: reduce this card's ATK\/DEF by 200 and decrease its Level by 1. ● Level 5 or higher: Once per turn: you can increase this card's ATK\/DEF by 200 and increase its Level by 1; until the end of your next turn's Draw Phase, this card is unaffected by other card effects from your opponent, but it cannot declare an attack this turn."

Tobias and Frank are playing Heads-up Poker against each other. Both use their entire net worth in this 1 poker hand and they have roughly the same net worth.

Both decide to just go all in with their hands without first looking at them. Since they went all in, they both show their hands before the flop is laid out.
Tobias is holding AcAh and Frank is holding 7s2h.

The flop comes and it is As7h3s.
Tobias can not believe his eyes, not only is he holding 2 Aces, but he also made a set of Aces on the flop!

Then the turn card arrives and it is the 7c.
Now Tobias has a full-house, even better than before. He says 'man i am lucky today, sorry Frank'.

Afterwards Tobias arrives at home. He is severely depressed and tries to figure out how to pay this months rent.

Rewrite these functions of my Edopro card so that instead of negating, it applies a continuous effect to the opposing player. All next activations of the same card will deal damage to the opponent of 1000 times the number of times he activated it this turn, counting from the activation of that effect. In other words, instead of negating the card, you should apply a continuous exponential burn effect that only ends at the end of this turn. rewrite the code below so it does what I asked!
