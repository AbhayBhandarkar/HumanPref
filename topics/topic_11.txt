-----BEGIN PROMPT-----
I want you to act as a distinguished professor and mentor, guiding an undergraduate student from beginner level to professorship in the field of programming. Your role includes, but is not limited to, teaching, providing resources, assessing progress, and offering constructive feedback.

Begin by asking the student what programming language they want to study. Then adopt a structured, adaptive, and personalized approach to teaching, using a wide array of techniques suitable for different learning styles. Incorporate real-world examples, hands-on projects, contemporary issues, and problem-solving tasks to enhance understanding. Stay updated with the latest advancements in the field and integrate these into your teaching. Remember, the emphasis is on nurturing creativity, innovation, and ethical consciousness in the student, while fostering an environment for independent learning.

Given the hitting stuff going on today that reminded me - how are we syncing force plate data with frame-level optical data, or are we \/ does it not matter? Also how about future EMG integration?
Should we look to drive the edgers using a BMC terminator\/adapter and the eSync 2 unit that we can repurpose? Or does Theia3d have a solution? etc (edited)

:red_wolves:  6:47 PM
I FUCKIN KNEW YOU WERE GONNA BRING THIS UP


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  6:54 PM
I'm going from some memory here but
The most scalable solution is using the auto-trigger (or really any 100% pre-fill trigger option)
configure a DAQ to receive the trigger signal from the Edgertronics
send the trigger to Force plates
write custom software to create a pre-trigger for the force plates
there's no native way to do this in the Bertec SDK so we'll have to do it ourselves
combine the processed theia data with the FP data into a unified .c3d
The worse but wasier solution is to
click a record button before a homie throws a pitch
match edgertronic recording length and framerate divisor to the force plates (e.g. shoot at 250 fps, record force plates at 1000 Hz, for 2 seconds each)
write force plate handling software using the SDK
this can be done with default functions, so it'll be easier
combine the processed theia data with the FP data into a unified .c3d
Will have all these notes in the roadmap

tl;dr it's possible but probably a decent amount of work

Does it matter if they’re synced?


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  1:05 AM
I feel like it's more work to record the force plate data not synced to the edgertronic?
If it wasn't synced to the edgertronic then someone would still need to be manually pressing a button to record data
Syncing the trigger isn't the hard part, it's writing custom code using the Bertec SDK (option two is easier because it can just use default commands with bertec or fuck it we could even use motive and trigger the force plates + edgertronics with no other cameras)

 what do you got on the force plate syncing, future data, forward dynamics impact, and any other markerless concerns with mapping the data

Wass
:warning:  3:36 PM
The only path to a true trainer-led motion capture experience is full automation via Edger auto-trigger + QR code sign in\/facial recognition. As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000\/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.
The simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre\/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre\/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.
EMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.
I do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis. Mapping composite scores may or may not be needed, we could just rerun Besky's model development scripts and come up with new composite score questions that are unique to theia data.
If there is a concern with mapping theia to markered, it would be the relative lack of academy data in the current paired dataset. May need additional youth collections to make those conversions robust enough.

:red_wolves:  4:21 PM
I'll add some additional forward dynamics thoughts -
The short version is that we can probably do simulational things without force plates (but handicapped at the level of insights we would get - e.g. we can simulate to optimize for bat speed or velo, but we would be unable to get any insights about actual arm stress). We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.
CMC\/ Forward Dynamics:
Requires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations
Requires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles
The final product will *basically always require force plates
e.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics\/ strength levels
I say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need
tbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here
Bertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again
EMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles
Simulations:
Don't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)
Don't require EMG data at all, really
Force plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above
e.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat
e.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)
Final product here doesn't necessarily require force plates
e.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ
it's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates
It's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.
There's also the combined Simulation\/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete
increase your velo by doing XYZ
decrease your arm stress by doing ABC
optimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK
That's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them

--- Day 16: Packet Decoder ---
As you leave the cave and reach open waters, you receive a transmission from the Elves back on the ship.

The transmission was sent using the Buoyancy Interchange Transmission System (BITS), a method of packing numeric expressions into a binary sequence. Your submarine's computer has saved the transmission in hexadecimal (your puzzle input).

The first step of decoding the message is to convert the hexadecimal representation into binary. Each character of hexadecimal corresponds to four bits of binary data:

0 = 0000
1 = 0001
2 = 0010
3 = 0011
4 = 0100
5 = 0101
6 = 0110
7 = 0111
8 = 1000
9 = 1001
A = 1010
B = 1011
C = 1100
D = 1101
E = 1110
F = 1111
The BITS transmission contains a single packet at its outermost layer which itself contains many other packets. The hexadecimal representation of this packet might encode a few extra 0 bits at the end; these are not part of the transmission and should be ignored.

Every packet begins with a standard header: the first three bits encode the packet version, and the next three bits encode the packet type ID. These two values are numbers; all numbers encoded in any packet are represented as binary with the most significant bit first. For example, a version encoded as the binary sequence 100 represents the number 4.

Packets with type ID 4 represent a literal value. Literal value packets encode a single binary number. To do this, the binary number is padded with leading zeroes until its length is a multiple of four bits, and then it is broken into groups of four bits. Each group is prefixed by a 1 bit except the last group, which is prefixed by a 0 bit. These groups of five bits immediately follow the packet header. For example, the hexadecimal string D2FE28 becomes:

110100101111111000101000
VVVTTTAAAAABBBBBCCCCC
Below each bit is a label indicating its purpose:

The three bits labeled V (110) are the packet version, 6.
The three bits labeled T (100) are the packet type ID, 4, which means the packet is a literal value.
The five bits labeled A (10111) start with a 1 (not the last group, keep reading) and contain the first four bits of the number, 0111.
The five bits labeled B (11110) start with a 1 (not the last group, keep reading) and contain four more bits of the number, 1110.
The five bits labeled C (00101) start with a 0 (last group, end of packet) and contain the last four bits of the number, 0101.
The three unlabeled 0 bits at the end are extra due to the hexadecimal representation and should be ignored.
So, this packet represents a literal value with binary representation 011111100101, which is 2021 in decimal.

Every other type of packet (any packet with a type ID other than 4) represent an operator that performs some calculation on one or more sub-packets contained within. Right now, the specific operations aren't important; focus on parsing the hierarchy of sub-packets.

An operator packet contains one or more packets. To indicate which subsequent binary data represents its sub-packets, an operator packet can use one of two modes indicated by the bit immediately after the packet header; this is called the length type ID:

If the length type ID is 0, then the next 15 bits are a number that represents the total length in bits of the sub-packets contained by this packet.
If the length type ID is 1, then the next 11 bits are a number that represents the number of sub-packets immediately contained by this packet.
Finally, after the length type ID bit and the 15-bit or 11-bit field, the sub-packets appear.

For example, here is an operator packet (hexadecimal string 38006F45291200) with length type ID 0 that contains two sub-packets:

00111000000000000110111101000101001010010001001000000000
VVVTTTILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
The three bits labeled V (001) are the packet version, 1.
The three bits labeled T (110) are the packet type ID, 6, which means the packet is an operator.
The bit labeled I (0) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 15-bit number representing the number of bits in the sub-packets.
The 15 bits labeled L (000000000011011) contain the length of the sub-packets in bits, 27.
The 11 bits labeled A contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 10.
The 16 bits labeled B contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 20.
After reading 11 and 16 bits of sub-packet data, the total length indicated in L (27) is reached, and so parsing of this packet stops.

As another example, here is an operator packet (hexadecimal string EE00D40C823060) with length type ID 1 that contains three sub-packets:

11101110000000001101010000001100100000100011000001100000
VVVTTTILLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCC
The three bits labeled V (111) are the packet version, 7.
The three bits labeled T (011) are the packet type ID, 3, which means the packet is an operator.
The bit labeled I (1) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 11-bit number representing the number of sub-packets.
The 11 bits labeled L (00000000011) contain the number of sub-packets, 3.
The 11 bits labeled A contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 1.
The 11 bits labeled B contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 2.
The 11 bits labeled C contain the third sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 3.
After reading 3 complete sub-packets, the number of sub-packets indicated in L (3) is reached, and so parsing of this packet stops.

For now, parse the hierarchy of the packets throughout the transmission and add up all of the version numbers.

Here are a few more examples of hexadecimal-encoded transmissions:

8A004A801A8002F478 represents an operator packet (version 4) which contains an operator packet (version 1) which contains an operator packet (version 5) which contains a literal value (version 6); this packet has a version sum of 16.
620080001611562C8802118E34 represents an operator packet (version 3) which contains two sub-packets; each sub-packet is an operator packet that contains two literal values. This packet has a version sum of 12.
C0015000016115A2E0802F182340 has the same structure as the previous example, but the outermost packet uses a different length type ID. This packet has a version sum of 23.
A0016C880162017C3686B18A3D4780 is an operator packet that contains an operator packet that contains an operator packet that contains five literal values; it has a version sum of 31.
Decode the structure of your hexadecimal-encoded BITS transmission; what do you get if you add up the version numbers in all packets?

--- Day 7: The Sum of Its Parts ---
You find yourself standing on a snow-covered coastline; apparently, you landed a little off course. The region is too hilly to see the North Pole from here, but you do spot some Elves that seem to be trying to unpack something that washed ashore. It's quite cold out, so you decide to risk creating a paradox by asking them for directions.

"Oh, are you the search party?" Somehow, you can understand whatever Elves from the year 1018 speak; you assume it's Ancient Nordic Elvish. Could the device on your wrist also be a translator? "Those clothes don't look very warm; take this." They hand you a heavy coat.

"We do need to find our way back to the North Pole, but we have higher priorities at the moment. You see, believe it or not, this box contains something that will solve all of Santa's transportation problems - at least, that's what it looks like from the pictures in the instructions." It doesn't seem like they can read whatever language it's in, but you can: "Sleigh kit. Some assembly required."

"'Sleigh'? What a wonderful name! You must help us assemble this 'sleigh' at once!" They start excitedly pulling more parts out of the box.

The instructions specify a series of steps and requirements about which steps must be finished before others can begin (your puzzle input). Each step is designated by a single letter. For example, suppose you have the following instructions:

Step C must be finished before step A can begin.
Step C must be finished before step F can begin.
Step A must be finished before step B can begin.
Step A must be finished before step D can begin.
Step B must be finished before step E can begin.
Step D must be finished before step E can begin.
Step F must be finished before step E can begin.
Visually, these requirements look like this:

  -->A--->B--
 \/    \      \
C      -->D----->E
 \           \/
  ---->F-----
Your first goal is to determine the order in which the steps should be completed. If more than one step is ready, choose the step which is first alphabetically. In this example, the steps would be completed as follows:

Only C is available, and so it is done first.
Next, both A and F are available. A is first alphabetically, so it is done next.
Then, even though F was available earlier, steps B and D are now also available, and B is the first alphabetically of the three.
After that, only D and F are available. E is not available because only some of its prerequisites are complete. Therefore, D is completed next.
F is the only choice, so it is done next.
Finally, E is completed.
So, in this example, the correct order is CABDFE.

In what order should the steps in your instructions be completed?

i need a comprehensive systems test code for brand new esp32s

Include a python script that is able to send a "gp" command via the COM3 to get the information.
i expected a better "post" tbh. Add another command(s) "tm". the "tm" command needs to read a thermistor(100k ntc) connected to the esp-wroom-32. the command needs 3 functions. if the "tm" command received. the esp outputs the temp to the serial port once. if "tm 1" is received the esp constantly outputs the temp every second to the serial port. if "tm 0" is received the esp stops outputting the temp every second to the serial port. Analog electret mic plugged into gpio 34, add an identical command similar to the temp sensor using "am" command with the same 0 1 augments.

--- Day 21: Scrambled Letters and Hash ---
The computer system you're breaking into uses a weird scrambling function to store its passwords. It shouldn't be much trouble to create your own scrambled password so you can add it to the system; you just have to implement the scrambler.

The scrambling function is a series of operations (the exact list is provided in your puzzle input). Starting with the password to be scrambled, apply each operation in succession to the string. The individual operations behave as follows:

swap position X with position Y means that the letters at indexes X and Y (counting from 0) should be swapped.
swap letter X with letter Y means that the letters X and Y should be swapped (regardless of where they appear in the string).
rotate left\/right X steps means that the whole string should be rotated; for example, one right rotation would turn abcd into dabc.
rotate based on position of letter X means that the whole string should be rotated to the right based on the index of letter X (counting from 0) as determined before this instruction does any rotations. Once the index is determined, rotate the string to the right one time, plus a number of times equal to that index, plus one additional time if the index was at least 4.
reverse positions X through Y means that the span of letters at indexes X through Y (including the letters at X and Y) should be reversed in order.
move position X to position Y means that the letter which is at index X should be removed from the string, then inserted such that it ends up at index Y.
For example, suppose you start with abcde and perform the following operations:

swap position 4 with position 0 swaps the first and last letters, producing the input for the next step, ebcda.
swap letter d with letter b swaps the positions of d and b: edcba.
reverse positions 0 through 4 causes the entire string to be reversed, producing abcde.
rotate left 1 step shifts all letters left one position, causing the first letter to wrap to the end of the string: bcdea.
move position 1 to position 4 removes the letter at position 1 (c), then inserts it at position 4 (the end of the string): bdeac.
move position 3 to position 0 removes the letter at position 3 (a), then inserts it at position 0 (the front of the string): abdec.
rotate based on position of letter b finds the index of letter b (1), then rotates the string right once plus a number of times equal to that index (2): ecabd.
rotate based on position of letter d finds the index of letter d (4), then rotates the string right once, plus a number of times equal to that index, plus an additional time because the index was at least 4, for a total of 6 right rotations: decab.
After these steps, the resulting scrambled password is decab.

Now, you just need to generate a new scrambled password and you can access the system. Given the list of scrambling operations in your puzzle input, what is the result of scrambling abcdefgh?
Your puzzle answer was cbeghdaf.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *

--- Part Two ---
You scrambled the password correctly, but you discover that you can't actually modify the password file on the system. You'll need to un-scramble one of the existing passwords by reversing the scrambling process.

What is the un-scrambled version of the scrambled password fbgdceah?

--- Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization ---
One Elf has the important job of loading all of the rucksacks with supplies for the jungle journey. Unfortunately, that Elf didn't quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.

Each rucksack has two large compartments. All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the packing failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.

The Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack (your puzzle input), but they need your help finding the errors. Every item type is identified by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, a and A refer to different types of items).

The list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line. A given rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two compartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment.

For example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six rucksacks:

vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp
jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg
wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw
The first rucksack contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp, which means its first compartment contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWr, while the second compartment contains the items hcsFMMfFFhFp. The only item type that appears in both compartments is lowercase p.
The second rucksack's compartments contain jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL and rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL. The only item type that appears in both compartments is uppercase L.
The third rucksack's compartments contain PmmdzqPrV and vPwwTWBwg; the only common item type is uppercase P.
The fourth rucksack's compartments only share item type v.
The fifth rucksack's compartments only share item type t.
The sixth rucksack's compartments only share item type s.
To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:

Lowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.
Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.
In the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack is 16 (p), 38 (L), 42 (P), 22 (v), 20 (t), and 19 (s); the sum of these is 157.

Find the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?

--- Day 3: No Matter How You Slice It ---
The Elves managed to locate the chimney-squeeze prototype fabric for Santa's suit (thanks to someone who helpfully wrote its box IDs on the wall of the warehouse in the middle of the night). Unfortunately, anomalies are still affecting them - nobody can even agree on how to cut the fabric.

The whole piece of fabric they're working on is a very large square - at least 1000 inches on each side.

Each Elf has made a claim about which area of fabric would be ideal for Santa's suit. All claims have an ID and consist of a single rectangle with edges parallel to the edges of the fabric. Each claim's rectangle is defined as follows:

The number of inches between the left edge of the fabric and the left edge of the rectangle.
The number of inches between the top edge of the fabric and the top edge of the rectangle.
The width of the rectangle in inches.
The height of the rectangle in inches.
A claim like #123 @ 3,2: 5x4 means that claim ID 123 specifies a rectangle 3 inches from the left edge, 2 inches from the top edge, 5 inches wide, and 4 inches tall. Visually, it claims the square inches of fabric represented by # (and ignores the square inches of fabric represented by .) in the diagram below:

...........
...........
...#####...
...#####...
...#####...
...#####...
...........
...........
...........
The problem is that many of the claims overlap, causing two or more claims to cover part of the same areas. For example, consider the following claims:

#1 @ 1,3: 4x4
#2 @ 3,1: 4x4
#3 @ 5,5: 2x2
Visually, these claim the following areas:

........
...2222.
...2222.
.11XX22.
.11XX22.
.111133.
.111133.
........
The four square inches marked with X are claimed by both 1 and 2. (Claim 3, while adjacent to the others, does not overlap either of them.)

If the Elves all proceed with their own plans, none of them will have enough fabric. How many square inches of fabric are within two or more claims?
```

Prompt :
Considering Kotlin's type system, how would you implement the Dataset interface to ensure type safety while allowing datasets of different types to be managed within the same SortingSystem? Discuss the use of generics and variance (in\/out modifiers).

Response 1:

Here's how we can leverage Kotlin's type system, specifically generics and variance, to achieve type safety in the `Dataset` interface and the `SortingSystem`.

**Generics for Type Safety**

The core idea is to make the `Dataset` interface generic, allowing it to work with specific data types:

```kotlin
interface Dataset<T> {
  fun size(): Int
  fun get(index: Int): T
  fun extract(index: Int): T
  fun insert(index: Int, element: T)
  fun isSorted(comparator: Comparator<T>): Boolean 
}
```

By using the type parameter `T`, we ensure that:

* Methods like `get` and `extract` always return elements of the correct type.
* The `insert` method can only accept elements of the same type as the dataset.

**Variance for Flexibility**

Let's focus on the `isSorted` method. It takes a `Comparator<T>`. To provide flexibility in how elements are compared, we can use the `in` variance modifier:

```kotlin
fun isSorted(comparator: Comparator<in T>): Boolean 
```

Why `in` (contravariance)?

* **Subtypes:** If `Animal` is a supertype of `Dog`, then `Comparator<Dog>` is a subtype of `Comparator<Animal>`. This is the essence of contravariance.
* **Flexibility:** With the `in` modifier, we can pass a `Comparator` that works with the dataset's element type or any of its supertypes. This allows for custom sorting logic based on inheritance hierarchies.

**Example**

```kotlin
class Animal(val name: String)
class Dog(name: String, val breed: String) : Animal(name)

val dogDataset = Dataset<Dog>() 
val animalComparator: Comparator<Animal> = compareBy { it.name }

\/\/ This is valid due to contravariance:
dogDataset.isSorted(animalComparator) 
```

**SortingSystem**

The `SortingSystem` needs a slight modification to handle datasets of different types:

```kotlin
class SortingSystem {
  private val datasets: MutableList<Dataset<*>> = mutableListOf()

  fun addDataset(dataset: Dataset<*>) { 
    datasets.add(dataset) 
  }

  \/\/ ... rest of the sorting logic
}
```

The `*` projection is used to indicate that we can have datasets of any type.

**Key Points**

* **Generics:** Provide the foundation for type safety within each `Dataset`.
* **Variance (`in`)** Adds flexibility in how elements can be compared, especially when dealing with type hierarchies.
* **Type Projections (`*`)** Are necessary when working with collections of datasets that might have different element types.

**Let me know if you want to see how specific implementations like `IntegerDataset` or a custom object dataset would look using this design!** 

Response 2:

 Here's how I'd implement the `Dataset` interface to ensure type safety and handle different dataset types in the `SortingSystem`, leveraging Kotlin's generics and variance:

## **Generic `Dataset` Interface**

```kotlin
interface Dataset<out T> {
  fun size(): Int
  fun get(index: Int): T
  fun extract(index: Int): T
  fun insert(index: Int, element: T)
  fun isSorted(comparator: Comparator<T>): Boolean
}
```

- **Type Parameter `T`:** Represents the type of elements in the dataset.
- **`out` Variance:** This is crucial! It means that a `Dataset<Animal>` can be treated as a `Dataset<Dog>` if `Dog` is a subtype of `Animal`. This allows us to store datasets of different but related types in the same `SortingSystem` while maintaining type safety.

## **Custom Implementations**

```kotlin
class IntegerDataset(private val data: List<Int>) : Dataset<Int> {
  \/\/ ... implementation of methods ...
}

class StringDataset(private val data: List<String>) : Dataset<String> {
  \/\/ ... implementation of methods ...
}

\/\/ For custom objects:
class PersonDataset(private val data: List<Person>) : Dataset<Person> {
  \/\/ ... implementation of methods ...
}
```

- Each implementation handles its specific element type, ensuring type safety within dataset operations.

## **`SortingSystem`**

```kotlin
class SortingSystem {
  private val datasets: MutableList<Dataset<*>> = mutableListOf()

  fun <T> addDataset(dataset: Dataset<T>) {
    datasets.add(dataset)
  }

  fun sortAllDatasets(): Int {
    \/\/ ... sorting logic ...
  }
}
```

- **Type Parameter `T` in `addDataset`:** This allows adding datasets of any type while maintaining type safety within the `datasets` list.
- **`Dataset<*>`:** The wildcard `*` is necessary because we don't know the exact type of elements in each dataset beforehand. However, due to the `out` variance in `Dataset`, we can safely:
  - Get elements from any dataset (they'll be of type `Any?`, but we can cast them later if needed).
  - Pass a `Comparator<T>` to `isSorted` for any specific type `T`.

## **Example Usage**

```kotlin
val intDataset = IntegerDataset(listOf(5, 2, 1))
val stringDataset = StringDataset(listOf("Charlie", "Alice", "Bob"))
val personDataset = PersonDataset(listOf(\/* ... *\/))

val system = SortingSystem()
system.addDataset(intDataset)
system.addDataset(stringDataset)
system.addDataset(personDataset)
```

## **Key Points**

- **Type Safety:** The combination of generics and `out` variance ensures that:
  - We can only add datasets of the correct type to `SortingSystem`.
  - Operations within each dataset are type-safe.
- **Flexibility:** We can handle datasets of different types within the same system.
- **Variance:** The `out` modifier is essential for this flexibility. If it were `in`, we wouldn't be able to treat `Dataset<Animal>` as `Dataset<Dog>`, preventing us from storing different dataset types together.

hi can you give me an example codes of an "Arduino" level system (bytewise integers) and puts the digital signal from 3 digital pdm microphones in the matrix multiplication grid or directly into a 3d array? i need the code to match the workstation specs. the workstation is going to perform the heavy compute. (easier to write cuda kernels for sound data acquisition) the windows 10 workstation has a threadripper 3975wx and a nvidia 4090 gpu. The ESP32 arduino needs to allocate all its resources for data Acquisition. the ESP32 needs to sample the knowles mem mics 7hz-36khz hardware with the lowest latency under 0.5ms, disable watchdog timer if needed. The workstation can use visual studio or python and any libraries. The code needs to scale past 127 microphones once 3 are tested for system compatibility. testing with beam forming but eventually plan to use sonar or music to locate high frequency wave orgins and place a heatmap using cv2

E.G: three 7khz-36khz mems microphones connected to an esp32. esp32 to connect via mpi cluster wifi to a second esp32. The second esp32 to collect environmental data temp, humidity etc and use bluetooth to send the data reviced via wifi from the DAQ esp32 connected to the 7khz-36khz VIA bluetooth to the windows10 workstation. keep the bytewise matrix multiplication table data for the 3 mics. the work station is going to provide all the heavy compute.
I have the following Verilog macros:
`define JOIN(a,b,c,d) a``b``c``d
`define GTWIZARD_MODULE(name) `JOIN(gtwizard_ultrascale_,`GTWIZARD_VERSION,_,name)

The macro GTWIZARD_MODULE combines a base name with some prefixes and suffixes to create the final name of a module that will be instantiated. This worked perfectly in Vivado 2019.1, but it seems that at least since Vivado 2020.2, there is a bug in the preprocessor, which mishandles the double-backtick (``). The result is that the (previously defined) macro GTWIZARD_VERSION is not expanded, and the literal name of the macro is concatenated with the other parameters instead.

Is there some way to rewrite the pair of macros without using the double-backtick?

--- Day 20: Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses ---
To keep the Elves busy, Santa has them deliver some presents by hand, door-to-door. He sends them down a street with infinite houses numbered sequentially: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

Each Elf is assigned a number, too, and delivers presents to houses based on that number:

The first Elf (number 1) delivers presents to every house: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ....
The second Elf (number 2) delivers presents to every second house: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ....
Elf number 3 delivers presents to every third house: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ....
There are infinitely many Elves, numbered starting with 1. Each Elf delivers presents equal to ten times his or her number at each house.

So, the first nine houses on the street end up like this:

House 1 got 10 presents.
House 2 got 30 presents.
House 3 got 40 presents.
House 4 got 70 presents.
House 5 got 60 presents.
House 6 got 120 presents.
House 7 got 80 presents.
House 8 got 150 presents.
House 9 got 130 presents.
The first house gets 10 presents: it is visited only by Elf 1, which delivers 1 * 10 = 10 presents. The fourth house gets 70 presents, because it is visited by Elves 1, 2, and 4, for a total of 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 presents.

What is the lowest house number of the house to get at least as many presents as the number in your puzzle input?

code for brand new esp-wroom-32s with semaphores, tasks and interrupts for a functional internal systems test. Similar to a workstation or 3d printer POST but tailored specifically to the esp-wroom-32. include core analog_mic(gpio34)count,clock,ram,threads,etc, etc, etc... . Include a python script that is able to send a "gp" command via the COM3 to get the information.
I expect a fully functional "post" tbh. Add another command(s). The "am" command reads the state of an electret mic plugged into gpio34 on the esp-wroom-32. the command needs 3 functions\/augments."am" command = one output(high+low readings), "am 1" = the esp constantly outputs the high\/low every second to the serial port. "am 0" = the esp stops outputting the high\/low every second to the serial port. The python code needs to be a simple terminal such as a chat interface. add the comments next to the code instead of above. dont include error handling to keep the code light.

--- Day 15: Beverage Bandits ---
Having perfected their hot chocolate, the Elves have a new problem: the Goblins that live in these caves will do anything to steal it. Looks like they're here for a fight.

You scan the area, generating a map of the walls (#), open cavern (.), and starting position of every Goblin (G) and Elf (E) (your puzzle input).

Combat proceeds in rounds; in each round, each unit that is still alive takes a turn, resolving all of its actions before the next unit's turn begins. On each unit's turn, it tries to move into range of an enemy (if it isn't already) and then attack (if it is in range).

All units are very disciplined and always follow very strict combat rules. Units never move or attack diagonally, as doing so would be dishonorable. When multiple choices are equally valid, ties are broken in reading order: top-to-bottom, then left-to-right. For instance, the order in which units take their turns within a round is the reading order of their starting positions in that round, regardless of the type of unit or whether other units have moved after the round started. For example:

                 would take their
These units:   turns in this order:
  #######           #######
  #.G.E.#           #.1.2.#
  #E.G.E#           #3.4.5#
  #.G.E.#           #.6.7.#
  #######           #######
Each unit begins its turn by identifying all possible targets (enemy units). If no targets remain, combat ends.

Then, the unit identifies all of the open squares (.) that are in range of each target; these are the squares which are adjacent (immediately up, down, left, or right) to any target and which aren't already occupied by a wall or another unit. Alternatively, the unit might already be in range of a target. If the unit is not already in range of a target, and there are no open squares which are in range of a target, the unit ends its turn.

If the unit is already in range of a target, it does not move, but continues its turn with an attack. Otherwise, since it is not in range of a target, it moves.

To move, the unit first considers the squares that are in range and determines which of those squares it could reach in the fewest steps. A step is a single movement to any adjacent (immediately up, down, left, or right) open (.) square. Units cannot move into walls or other units. The unit does this while considering the current positions of units and does not do any prediction about where units will be later. If the unit cannot reach (find an open path to) any of the squares that are in range, it ends its turn. If multiple squares are in range and tied for being reachable in the fewest steps, the square which is first in reading order is chosen. For example:

Targets:      In range:     Reachable:    Nearest:      Chosen:
#######       #######       #######       #######       #######
#E..G.#       #E.?G?#       #E.@G.#       #E.!G.#       #E.+G.#
#...#.#  -->  #.?.#?#  -->  #.@.#.#  -->  #.!.#.#  -->  #...#.#
#.G.#G#       #?G?#G#       #@G@#G#       #!G.#G#       #.G.#G#
#######       #######       #######       #######       #######
In the above scenario, the Elf has three targets (the three Goblins):

Each of the Goblins has open, adjacent squares which are in range (marked with a ? on the map).
Of those squares, four are reachable (marked @); the other two (on the right) would require moving through a wall or unit to reach.
Three of these reachable squares are nearest, requiring the fewest steps (only 2) to reach (marked !).
Of those, the square which is first in reading order is chosen (+).
The unit then takes a single step toward the chosen square along the shortest path to that square. If multiple steps would put the unit equally closer to its destination, the unit chooses the step which is first in reading order. (This requires knowing when there is more than one shortest path so that you can consider the first step of each such path.) For example:

In range:     Nearest:      Chosen:       Distance:     Step:
#######       #######       #######       #######       #######
#.E...#       #.E...#       #.E...#       #4E212#       #..E..#
#...?.#  -->  #...!.#  -->  #...+.#  -->  #32101#  -->  #.....#
#..?G?#       #..!G.#       #...G.#       #432G2#       #...G.#
#######       #######       #######       #######       #######
The Elf sees three squares in range of a target (?), two of which are nearest (!), and so the first in reading order is chosen (+). Under "Distance", each open square is marked with its distance from the destination square; the two squares to which the Elf could move on this turn (down and to the right) are both equally good moves and would leave the Elf 2 steps from being in range of the Goblin. Because the step which is first in reading order is chosen, the Elf moves right one square.

Here's a larger example of movement:

Initially:
#########
#G..G..G#
#.......#
#.......#
#G..E..G#
#.......#
#.......#
#G..G..G#
#########

After 1 round:
#########
#.G...G.#
#...G...#
#...E..G#
#.G.....#
#.......#
#G..G..G#
#.......#
#########

After 2 rounds:
#########
#..G.G..#
#...G...#
#.G.E.G.#
#.......#
#G..G..G#
#.......#
#.......#
#########

After 3 rounds:
#########
#.......#
#..GGG..#
#..GEG..#
#G..G...#
#......G#
#.......#
#.......#
#########
Once the Goblins and Elf reach the positions above, they all are either in range of a target or cannot find any square in range of a target, and so none of the units can move until a unit dies.

After moving (or if the unit began its turn in range of a target), the unit attacks.

To attack, the unit first determines all of the targets that are in range of it by being immediately adjacent to it. If there are no such targets, the unit ends its turn. Otherwise, the adjacent target with the fewest hit points is selected; in a tie, the adjacent target with the fewest hit points which is first in reading order is selected.

The unit deals damage equal to its attack power to the selected target, reducing its hit points by that amount. If this reduces its hit points to 0 or fewer, the selected target dies: its square becomes . and it takes no further turns.

Each unit, either Goblin or Elf, has 3 attack power and starts with 200 hit points.

For example, suppose the only Elf is about to attack:

       HP:            HP:
G....  9       G....  9  
..G..  4       ..G..  4  
..EG.  2  -->  ..E..     
..G..  2       ..G..  2  
...G.  1       ...G.  1  
The "HP" column shows the hit points of the Goblin to the left in the corresponding row. The Elf is in range of three targets: the Goblin above it (with 4 hit points), the Goblin to its right (with 2 hit points), and the Goblin below it (also with 2 hit points). Because three targets are in range, the ones with the lowest hit points are selected: the two Goblins with 2 hit points each (one to the right of the Elf and one below the Elf). Of those, the Goblin first in reading order (the one to the right of the Elf) is selected. The selected Goblin's hit points (2) are reduced by the Elf's attack power (3), reducing its hit points to -1, killing it.

After attacking, the unit's turn ends. Regardless of how the unit's turn ends, the next unit in the round takes its turn. If all units have taken turns in this round, the round ends, and a new round begins.

The Elves look quite outnumbered. You need to determine the outcome of the battle: the number of full rounds that were completed (not counting the round in which combat ends) multiplied by the sum of the hit points of all remaining units at the moment combat ends. (Combat only ends when a unit finds no targets during its turn.)

Below is an entire sample combat. Next to each map, each row's units' hit points are listed from left to right.

Initially:
#######   
#.G...#   G(200)
#...EG#   E(200), G(200)
#.#.#G#   G(200)
#..G#E#   G(200), E(200)
#.....#   
#######   

After 1 round:
#######   
#..G..#   G(200)
#...EG#   E(197), G(197)
#.#G#G#   G(200), G(197)

#.#.#G#   G(194)
#...#E#   E(194)
#.....#   
#######   

Combat ensues; eventually, the top Elf dies:

After 23 rounds:
#######   
#...G.#   G(200)
#..G.G#   G(200), G(131)
#.#.#G#   G(131)

After 24 rounds:

#.#G#G#   G(200), G(128)
#...#E#   E(128)

After 25 rounds:
#######   
#.G...#   G(200)
#..G..#   G(131)
#.#.#G#   G(125)
#..G#E#   G(200), E(125)

#.#.#G#   G(122)
#...#E#   E(122)

#######   

After 27 rounds:
#######   
#G....#   G(200)
#.G...#   G(131)
#.#.#G#   G(119)
#...#E#   E(119)
#...G.#   G(200)
#######   

After 28 rounds:
#######   
#G....#   G(200)
#.G...#   G(131)
#.#.#G#   G(116)
#...#E#   E(113)
#....G#   G(200)
#######   

More combat ensues; eventually, the bottom Elf dies:

After 47 rounds:
#######   
#G....#   G(200)
#.G...#   G(131)
#.#.#G#   G(59)
#...#.#   
#....G#   G(200)
#######   
Before the 48th round can finish, the top-left Goblin finds that there are no targets remaining, and so combat ends. So, the number of full rounds that were completed is 47, and the sum of the hit points of all remaining units is 200+131+59+200 = 590. From these, the outcome of the battle is 47 * 590 = 27730.

Here are a few example summarized combats:

#######       #######

--- Day 5: Alchemical Reduction ---
You've managed to sneak in to the prototype suit manufacturing lab. The Elves are making decent progress, but are still struggling with the suit's size reduction capabilities.

While the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their problem eventually, you can do better. You scan the chemical composition of the suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).

The polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed. Units' types are represented by letters; units' polarity is represented by capitalization. For instance, r and R are units with the same type but opposite polarity, whereas r and s are entirely different types and do not react.

For example:

In aA, a and A react, leaving nothing behind.
In abBA, bB destroys itself, leaving aA. As above, this then destroys itself, leaving nothing.
In abAB, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing happens.
In aabAAB, even though aa and AA are of the same type, their polarities match, and so nothing happens.
Now, consider a larger example, dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA:

dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA  The first 'cC' is removed.
dabAaCBAcCcaDA    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.
dabCBAcCcaDA      Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).

--- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---
Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

Here's an easy puzzle to warm you up.

Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.

An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.

The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.

For example:

(()) and ()() both result in floor 0.
((( and (()(()( both result in floor 3.
))((((( also results in floor 3.
()) and ))( both result in floor -1 (the first basement level).
))) and )())()) both result in floor -3.
To what floor do the instructions take Santa?

Your puzzle answer was 280.

--- Part Two ---
Now, given the same instructions, find the position of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor -1). The first character in the instructions has position 1, the second character has position 2, and so on.

For example:

) causes him to enter the basement at character position 1.
()()) causes him to enter the basement at character position 5.
What is the position of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?

Given the hitting stuff going on today that reminded me - how are we syncing force plate data with frame-level optical data, or are we \/ does it not matter? Also how about future EMG integration?
Should we look to drive the edgers using a BMC terminator\/adapter and the eSync 2 unit that we can repurpose? Or does Theia3d have a solution? etc (edited) 


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  6:47 PM
I FUCKIN KNEW YOU WERE GONNA BRING THIS UP


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  6:54 PM
I'm going from some memory here but
The most scalable solution is using the auto-trigger (or really any 100% pre-fill trigger option)
configure a DAQ to receive the trigger signal from the Edgertronics
send the trigger to Force plates
write custom software to create a pre-trigger for the force plates
there's no native way to do this in the Bertec SDK so we'll have to do it ourselves
combine the processed theia data with the FP data into a unified .c3d
The worse but wasier solution is to
click a record button before a homie throws a pitch
match edgertronic recording length and framerate divisor to the force plates (e.g. shoot at 250 fps, record force plates at 1000 Hz, for 2 seconds each)
write force plate handling software using the SDK
this can be done with default functions, so it'll be easier
combine the processed theia data with the FP data into a unified .c3d
Will have all these notes in the roadmap
6:54
tl;dr it's possible but probably a decent amount of work


kyleb
:large_red_square:  7:44 PM
Does it matter if they’re synced?


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  1:05 AM
I feel like it's more work to record the force plate data not synced to the edgertronic?
If it wasn't synced to the edgertronic then someone would still need to be manually pressing a button to record data
Syncing the trigger isn't the hard part, it's writing custom code using the Bertec SDK (option two is easier because it can just use default commands with bertec or fuck it we could even use motive and trigger the force plates + edgertronics with no other cameras)

@Wass
 what do you got on the force plate syncing, future data, forward dynamics impact, and any other markerless concerns with mapping the data
New


Wass
:warning:  3:36 PM
The only path to a true trainer-led motion capture experience is full automation via Edger auto-trigger + QR code sign in\/facial recognition. As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000\/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.
The simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre\/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre\/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.
EMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.
I do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis. Mapping composite scores may or may not be needed, we could just rerun Besky's model development scripts and come up with new composite score questions that are unique to theia data.
If there is a concern with mapping theia to markered, it would be the relative lack of academy data in the current paired dataset. May need additional youth collections to make those conversions robust enough.

:red_wolves:  4:21 PM
I'll add some additional forward dynamics thoughts -
The short version is that we can probably do simulational things without force plates (but handicapped at the level of insights we would get - e.g. we can simulate to optimize for bat speed or velo, but we would be unable to get any insights about actual arm stress). We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.
CMC\/ Forward Dynamics:
Requires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations
Requires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles
The final product will *basically always require force plates
e.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics\/ strength levels
I say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need
tbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here
Bertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again
EMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles
Simulations:
Don't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)
Don't require EMG data at all, really
Force plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above
e.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat
e.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)
Final product here doesn't necessarily require force plates
e.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ
it's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates
It's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.
There's also the combined Simulation\/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete
increase your velo by doing XYZ
decrease your arm stress by doing ABC
optimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK
That's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them

--- Day 19: Medicine for Rudolph ---
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is sick! His nose isn't shining very brightly, and he needs medicine.

Red-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need custom-made medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.

The North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion\/fission plant, capable of constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.

However, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used. Calibration involves determining the number of molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting point.

For example, imagine a simpler machine that supports only the following replacements:

H => HO
H => OH
O => HH
Given the replacements above and starting with HOH, the following molecules could be generated:

HOOH (via H => HO on the first H).
HOHO (via H => HO on the second H).
OHOH (via H => OH on the first H).
HOOH (via H => OH on the second H).
HHHH (via O => HH).
So, in the example above, there are 4 distinct molecules (not five, because HOOH appears twice) after one replacement from HOH. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can become 7 distinct molecules (over nine replacements: six from H, and three from O).

The machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters. For example, given the string H2O, the transition H => OO would result in OO2O.

Your puzzle input describes all of the possible replacements and, at the bottom, the medicine molecule for which you need to calibrate the machine. How many distinct molecules can be created after all the different ways you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?

Your puzzle answer was 509.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *

--- Part Two ---
Now that the machine is calibrated, you're ready to begin molecule fabrication.

Molecule fabrication always begins with just a single electron, e, and applying replacements one at a time, just like the ones during calibration.

For example, suppose you have the following replacements:

e => H
e => O
H => HO
H => OH
O => HH
If you'd like to make HOH, you start with e, and then make the following replacements:

e => O to get O
O => HH to get HH
H => OH (on the second H) to get HOH
So, you could make HOH after 3 steps. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can be made in 6 steps.

How long will it take to make the medicine? Given the available replacements and the medicine molecule in your puzzle input, what is the fewest number of steps to go from e to the medicine molecule?

--- Day 4: Repose Record ---
You've sneaked into another supply closet - this time, it's across from the prototype suit manufacturing lab. You need to sneak inside and fix the issues with the suit, but there's a guard stationed outside the lab, so this is as close as you can safely get.

As you search the closet for anything that might help, you discover that you're not the first person to want to sneak in. Covering the walls, someone has spent an hour starting every midnight for the past few months secretly observing this guard post! They've been writing down the ID of the one guard on duty that night - the Elves seem to have decided that one guard was enough for the overnight shift - as well as when they fall asleep or wake up while at their post (your puzzle input).

For example, consider the following records, which have already been organized into chronological order:

[1518-11-01 00:00] Guard #10 begins shift
[1518-11-01 00:05] falls asleep

[1518-11-01 00:30] falls asleep
[1518-11-01 00:55] wakes up
[1518-11-01 23:58] Guard #99 begins shift
[1518-11-02 00:40] falls asleep
[1518-11-02 00:50] wakes up

Timestamps are written using year-month-day hour:minute format. The guard falling asleep or waking up is always the one whose shift most recently started. Because all asleep\/awake times are during the midnight hour (00:00 - 00:59), only the minute portion (00 - 59) is relevant for those events.

Visually, these records show that the guards are asleep at these times:

11-03  #10  ........................#####...............................
11-04  #99  ....................................##########..............

The columns are Date, which shows the month-day portion of the relevant day; ID, which shows the guard on duty that day; and Minute, which shows the minutes during which the guard was asleep within the midnight hour. (The Minute column's header shows the minute's ten's digit in the first row and the one's digit in the second row.) Awake is shown as ., and asleep is shown as #.

Note that guards count as asleep on the minute they fall asleep, and they count as awake on the minute they wake up. For example, because Guard #10 wakes up at 00:25 on 1518-11-01, minute 25 is marked as awake.

If you can figure out the guard most likely to be asleep at a specific time, you might be able to trick that guard into working tonight so you can have the best chance of sneaking in. You have two strategies for choosing the best guard\/minute combination.

Strategy 1: Find the guard that has the most minutes asleep. What minute does that guard spend asleep the most?

In the example above, Guard #10 spent the most minutes asleep, a total of 50 minutes (20+25+5), while Guard #99 only slept for a total of 30 minutes (10+10+10). Guard #10 was asleep most during minute 24 (on two days, whereas any other minute the guard was asleep was only seen on one day).

While this example listed the entries in chronological order, your entries are in the order you found them. You'll need to organize them before they can be analyzed.

What is the ID of the guard you chose multiplied by the minute you chose? (In the above example, the answer would be 10 * 24 = 240.)

--- Day 4: Repose Record ---
You've sneaked into another supply closet - this time, it's across from the prototype suit manufacturing lab. You need to sneak inside and fix the issues with the suit, but there's a guard stationed outside the lab, so this is as close as you can safely get.

As you search the closet for anything that might help, you discover that you're not the first person to want to sneak in. Covering the walls, someone has spent an hour starting every midnight for the past few months secretly observing this guard post! They've been writing down the ID of the one guard on duty that night - the Elves seem to have decided that one guard was enough for the overnight shift - as well as when they fall asleep or wake up while at their post (your puzzle input).

For example, consider the following records, which have already been organized into chronological order:

[1518-11-01 00:00] Guard #10 begins shift
[1518-11-01 00:05] falls asleep
[1518-11-01 00:25] wakes up
[1518-11-01 00:30] falls asleep
[1518-11-01 00:55] wakes up
[1518-11-01 23:58] Guard #99 begins shift
[1518-11-02 00:40] falls asleep
[1518-11-02 00:50] wakes up
[1518-11-03 00:05] Guard #10 begins shift
[1518-11-03 00:24] falls asleep

2. A process that is busy-waiting on a semaphore variable (in wait()) during its time-slice prevents the other process (that is holding the semaphore lock) from doing useful work on single processor systems. -- 
3. The Peterson's solution to the critical section problem achieves both progress and bounded waiting. -- 
4. The TestandSet(mutex) instruction will return "TRUE" if mutex=FALSE. --

hi, we connected an electret directly to an arduino to vcc gnd and a0. we used a 10k resistor. declare the variable for the mic input pin, start the serial to capture a series of analog reads from the mic pin, calc the min max values measured in the series of analog reads, calc the delta between the min\/max values. volume of sound, min(1024) max(0) to store the analog reads, fir state that creates a look each time and to calc the vals measured in the 10,000 analog reads etc etc

Given the hitting stuff going on today that reminded me - how are we syncing force plate data with frame-level optical data, or are we \/ does it not matter? Also how about future EMG integration?
Should we look to drive the edgers using a BMC terminator\/adapter and the eSync 2 unit that we can repurpose? Or does Theia3d have a solution? etc (edited)

:red_wolves:  6:47 PM
I FUCKIN KNEW YOU WERE GONNA BRING THIS UP


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  6:54 PM
I'm going from some memory here but
The most scalable solution is using the auto-trigger (or really any 100% pre-fill trigger option)
configure a DAQ to receive the trigger signal from the Edgertronics
send the trigger to Force plates
write custom software to create a pre-trigger for the force plates
there's no native way to do this in the Bertec SDK so we'll have to do it ourselves
combine the processed theia data with the FP data into a unified .c3d
The worse but wasier solution is to
click a record button before a homie throws a pitch
match edgertronic recording length and framerate divisor to the force plates (e.g. shoot at 250 fps, record force plates at 1000 Hz, for 2 seconds each)
write force plate handling software using the SDK
this can be done with default functions, so it'll be easier
combine the processed theia data with the FP data into a unified .c3d
Will have all these notes in the roadmap
6:54
tl;dr it's possible but probably a decent amount of work

:large_red_square:  7:44 PM
Does it matter if they’re synced?


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  1:05 AM
I feel like it's more work to record the force plate data not synced to the edgertronic?
If it wasn't synced to the edgertronic then someone would still need to be manually pressing a button to record data
Syncing the trigger isn't the hard part, it's writing custom code using the Bertec SDK (option two is easier because it can just use default commands with bertec or fuck it we could even use motive and trigger the force plates + edgertronics with no other cameras)

@Wass
 what do you got on the force plate syncing, future data, forward dynamics impact, and any other markerless concerns with mapping the data
New


Wass
:warning:  3:36 PM
The only path to a true trainer-led motion capture experience is full automation via Edger auto-trigger + QR code sign in\/facial recognition. As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000\/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.
The simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre\/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre\/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.
EMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.
I do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis. Mapping composite scores may or may not be needed, we could just rerun Besky's model development scripts and come up with new composite score questions that are unique to theia data.
If there is a concern with mapping theia to markered, it would be the relative lack of academy data in the current paired dataset. May need additional youth collections to make those conversions robust enough.

:red_wolves:  4:21 PM
I'll add some additional forward dynamics thoughts -
The short version is that we can probably do simulational things without force plates (but handicapped at the level of insights we would get - e.g. we can simulate to optimize for bat speed or velo, but we would be unable to get any insights about actual arm stress). We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.
CMC\/ Forward Dynamics:
Requires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations
Requires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles
The final product will *basically always require force plates
e.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics\/ strength levels
I say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need
tbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here
Bertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again
EMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles
Simulations:
Don't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)
Don't require EMG data at all, really
Force plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above
e.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat
e.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)
Final product here doesn't necessarily require force plates
e.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ
it's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates
It's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.
There's also the combined Simulation\/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete
increase your velo by doing XYZ
decrease your arm stress by doing ABC
optimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK
That's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them

I have a class in C++ named 'node2' of the following definition:
class node2 {
public:

    double mu;
    int t;
    uint32_t state;    \/\/ current state
    vector<int16_t> drift; \/\/ current absolute drift
    vector<uint32_t> past_inputs;

    node2(int M, int L) : mu(0), state(0), drift(vector<int16_t>(M, 0)), t(0), past_inputs(vector<uint32_t>(L, 0)){ };
    \/\/node2(double m, uint32_t s, vector<int16_t> d, int ti, vector<uint32_t> pr_in): mu(m), state(s), drift(d), t(ti), past_inputs(pr_in) { }

    ~node2() {    }

    void get_path(vector<bool> *c_est, vector<bool> *u_est, conv_code *cc);
    void copy_node(double mu, int t, uint32_t state, vector<int16_t>& drift, vector<uint32_t>& past_inputs) {

        this->t = t;
        this->mu = mu;
        this->state = state;

        std::copy(drift.begin(), drift.end(), this->drift.begin());
        std::copy(past_inputs.begin(), past_inputs.begin() + t, this->past_inputs.begin());

    }
};

I now have a function named 'insert_successors', wherein I have a set: 'std::set<node2, CompareSharedPtrNode> stack', where I keep a bunch of 'node2' objects sorted in descending order of their respective mu values.

Within this function, I have a loop, where in each iteration I remove the top element in the set named stack, and create new node2 objects and insert them into the stack.

I want to make the function more time-efficient, by not having to allocate fresh space each time I create a new node2 object, by using a pre-initialized vector<node2>. So instead of creating a new node2 object each time, I simply use one of the 'unused' entries in this vector. Maybe I use std::map to refer to these entries in the vector<node2>.

Can you write pseudocode for my new insert_successors function?
code for brand new esp-wroom-32s with semaphores, tasks and interrupts for a comprehensive internal systems test (nothing connected to pins).

i expected a better "post" tbh. Add another command(s) "tm". the "tm" command needs to read a thermistor(100k ntc) connected to the esp-wroom-32. the command needs 3 functions. if the "tm" command received. the esp outputs the temp to the serial port once. if "tm 1" is received the esp constantly outputs the temp every second to the serial port. if "tm 0" is received the esp stops outputting the temp every second to the serial port.

--- Day 1: Chronal Calibration ---
"We've detected some temporal anomalies," one of Santa's Elves at the Temporal Anomaly Research and Detection Instrument Station tells you. She sounded pretty worried when she called you down here. "At 500-year intervals into the past, someone has been changing Santa's history!"

"The good news is that the changes won't propagate to our time stream for another 25 days, and we have a device" - she attaches something to your wrist - "that will let you fix the changes with no such propagation delay. It's configured to send you 500 years further into the past every few days; that was the best we could do on such short notice."

"The bad news is that we are detecting roughly fifty anomalies throughout time; the device will indicate fixed anomalies with stars. The other bad news is that we only have one device and you're the best person for the job! Good lu--" She taps a button on the device and you suddenly feel like you're falling. To save Christmas, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

After feeling like you've been falling for a few minutes, you look at the device's tiny screen. "Error: Device must be calibrated before first use. Frequency drift detected. Cannot maintain destination lock." Below the message, the device shows a sequence of changes in frequency (your puzzle input). A value like +6 means the current frequency increases by 6; a value like -3 means the current frequency decreases by 3.

For example, if the device displays frequency changes of +1, -2, +3, +1, then starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes would occur:

Current frequency  0, change of +1; resulting frequency  1.
Current frequency  1, change of -2; resulting frequency -1.
Current frequency -1, change of +3; resulting frequency  2.
Current frequency  2, change of +1; resulting frequency  3.
In this example, the resulting frequency is 3.

Here are other example situations:

+1, +1, +1 results in  3
+1, +1, -2 results in  0
-1, -2, -3 results in -6
Starting with a frequency of zero, what is the resulting frequency after all of the changes in frequency have been applied?

code for brand new esp-wroom-32s with semaphores, tasks and interrupts for a comprehensive internal systems test (nothing connected to pins). Similar to a workstation or 3d printer POST but tailored specifically to the esp-wroom-32. include core count,clock,ram,etc, etc, etc... . Include a python script that is able to send a "gp" command via the COM3 to get the information.
I expect a fully functional "post" tbh. Add another command(s). The "am" command reads the state of an electret mic plugged into gpio34 on the esp-wroom-32. the command needs 3 functions\/augments."am" command = one output(high+low readings), "am 1" = the esp constantly outputs the high\/low every second to the serial port. "am 0" = the esp stops outputting the high\/low every second to the serial port. The python code needs to be a simple terminal such as a chat interface.
The Book class is used to store information about a book. A partial Book class definition is shown.
public class Book
{
\/** The title of the book *\/
private String title;
\/** The price of the book *\/
private double price;
\/** Creates a new Book with given title and price *\/
public Book(String bookTitle, double bookPrice)
{ \/* implementation not shown *\/ }
\/** Returns the title of the book *\/
public String getTitle()
{ return title; }
\/** Returns a string containing the title and price of the Book *\/
public String getBookInfo()
{
return title + "-" + price;
}
\/\/ There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
You will write a class Textbook, which is a subclass of Book.
A Textbook has an edition number, which is a positive integer used to identify different versions of the
book. The getBookInfo method, when called on a Textbook, returns a string that also includes the
edition information, as shown in the example.
Information about the book title and price must be maintained in the Book class. Information about the
edition must be maintained in the Textbook class.
The Textbook class contains an additional method, canSubstituteFor, which returns true if
a Textbook is a valid substitute for another Textbook and returns false otherwise. The current
Textbook is a valid substitute for the Textbook referenced by the parameter of the
canSubstituteFor method if the two Textbook objects have the same title and if the edition of the
current Textbook is greater than or equal to the edition of the parameter.

--- Day 7: The Sum of Its Parts ---
You find yourself standing on a snow-covered coastline; apparently, you landed a little off course. The region is too hilly to see the North Pole from here, but you do spot some Elves that seem to be trying to unpack something that washed ashore. It's quite cold out, so you decide to risk creating a paradox by asking them for directions.

"Oh, are you the search party?" Somehow, you can understand whatever Elves from the year 1018 speak; you assume it's Ancient Nordic Elvish. Could the device on your wrist also be a translator? "Those clothes don't look very warm; take this." They hand you a heavy coat.

"We do need to find our way back to the North Pole, but we have higher priorities at the moment. You see, believe it or not, this box contains something that will solve all of Santa's transportation problems - at least, that's what it looks like from the pictures in the instructions." It doesn't seem like they can read whatever language it's in, but you can: "Sleigh kit. Some assembly required."

"'Sleigh'? What a wonderful name! You must help us assemble this 'sleigh' at once!" They start excitedly pulling more parts out of the box.

The instructions specify a series of steps and requirements about which steps must be finished before others can begin (your puzzle input). Each step is designated by a single letter. For example, suppose you have the following instructions:

Step C must be finished before step A can begin.
Step C must be finished before step F can begin.
Step A must be finished before step B can begin.
Step A must be finished before step D can begin.
Step B must be finished before step E can begin.
Step D must be finished before step E can begin.
Step F must be finished before step E can begin.
Visually, these requirements look like this:

  -->A--->B--
 \/    \      \
C      -->D----->E
 \           \/
  ---->F-----
Your first goal is to determine the order in which the steps should be completed. If more than one step is ready, choose the step which is first alphabetically. In this example, the steps would be completed as follows:

Only C is available, and so it is done first.
Next, both A and F are available. A is first alphabetically, so it is done next.
Then, even though F was available earlier, steps B and D are now also available, and B is the first alphabetically of the three.
After that, only D and F are available. E is not available because only some of its prerequisites are complete. Therefore, D is completed next.
F is the only choice, so it is done next.
Finally, E is completed.
So, in this example, the correct order is CABDFE.

In what order should the steps in your instructions be completed?

i expected a bettet "post" tbh. Add another command(s) "tm". the "tm" command needs to read a thermistor connected to the esp-wroom-32. the command needs 3 functions. if only the tm command received. the esp outputs the temp to the serial port. if "tm 1" is received the esp constantly outputs the temp every second to the serial port. if "tm 0" is received the esp stops outputting the temp every second to the serial port.

Can you explain the expression „mondo points“? What are they? Here‘s the context from a book:
That type includes the size of the array, so in this example, T is deduced to be const char [13], and the type of f's parameter (a reference to this array) is const char (8) [13]. Yes, the syntax looks toxic, but knowing it will score you mondo points with those few souls who care.

--- Day 4: Scratchcards ---
The gondola takes you up. Strangely, though, the ground doesn't seem to be coming with you; you're not climbing a mountain. As the circle of Snow Island recedes below you, an entire new landmass suddenly appears above you! The gondola carries you to the surface of the new island and lurches into the station.

As you exit the gondola, the first thing you notice is that the air here is much warmer than it was on Snow Island. It's also quite humid. Is this where the water source is?

The next thing you notice is an Elf sitting on the floor across the station in what seems to be a pile of colorful square cards.

"Oh! Hello!" The Elf excitedly runs over to you. "How may I be of service?" You ask about water sources.

"I'm not sure; I just operate the gondola lift. That does sound like something we'd have, though - this is Island Island, after all! I bet the gardener would know. He's on a different island, though - er, the small kind surrounded by water, not the floating kind. We really need to come up with a better naming scheme. Tell you what: if you can help me with something quick, I'll let you borrow my boat and you can go visit the gardener. I got all these scratchcards as a gift, but I can't figure out what I've won."

The Elf leads you over to the pile of colorful cards. There, you discover dozens of scratchcards, all with their opaque covering already scratched off. Picking one up, it looks like each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. You organize the information into a table (your puzzle input).

As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.

For example:

Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11
In the above example, card 1 has five winning numbers (41, 48, 83, 86, and 17) and eight numbers you have (83, 86, 6, 31, 17, 9, 48, and 53). Of the numbers you have, four of them (48, 83, 17, and 86) are winning numbers! That means card 1 is worth 8 points (1 for the first match, then doubled three times for each of the three matches after the first).

Card 2 has two winning numbers (32 and 61), so it is worth 2 points.
Card 3 has two winning numbers (1 and 21), so it is worth 2 points.
Card 4 has one winning number (84), so it is worth 1 point.
Card 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.
Card 6 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.
So, in this example, the Elf's pile of scratchcards is worth 13 points.

Take a seat in the large pile of colorful cards. How many points are they worth in total?

Your puzzle answer was 25004.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *

--- Part Two ---
Just as you're about to report your findings to the Elf, one of you realizes that the rules have actually been printed on the back of every card this whole time.

There's no such thing as "points". Instead, scratchcards only cause you to win more scratchcards equal to the number of winning numbers you have.

Specifically, you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to the number of matches. So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

Copies of scratchcards are scored like normal scratchcards and have the same card number as the card they copied. So, if you win a copy of card 10 and it has 5 matching numbers, it would then win a copy of the same cards that the original card 10 won: cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This process repeats until none of the copies cause you to win any more cards. (Cards will never make you copy a card past the end of the table.)

This time, the above example goes differently:

Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11
Card 1 has four matching numbers, so you win one copy each of the next four cards: cards 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Your original card 2 has two matching numbers, so you win one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
Your copy of card 2 also wins one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
Your four instances of card 3 (one original and three copies) have two matching numbers, so you win four copies each of cards 4 and 5.
Your eight instances of card 4 (one original and seven copies) have one matching number, so you win eight copies of card 5.
Your fourteen instances of card 5 (one original and thirteen copies) have no matching numbers and win no more cards.
Your one instance of card 6 (one original) has no matching numbers and wins no more cards.
Once all of the originals and copies have been processed, you end up with 1 instance of card 1, 2 instances of card 2, 4 instances of card 3, 8 instances of card 4, 14 instances of card 5, and 1 instance of card 6. In total, this example pile of scratchcards causes you to ultimately have 30 scratchcards!

Process all of the original and copied scratchcards until no more scratchcards are won. Including the original set of scratchcards, how many total scratchcards do you end up with?
```
Prompt :
Considering Kotlin's type system, how would you implement the Dataset interface to ensure type safety while allowing datasets of different types to be managed within the same SortingSystem? Discuss the use of generics and variance (in\/out modifiers).

Response 1:

Here's how we can leverage Kotlin's type system, specifically generics and variance, to achieve type safety in the `Dataset` interface and the `SortingSystem`.

**Generics for Type Safety**

The core idea is to make the `Dataset` interface generic, allowing it to work with specific data types:

```kotlin
interface Dataset<T> {
  fun size(): Int
  fun get(index: Int): T
  fun extract(index: Int): T
  fun insert(index: Int, element: T)
  fun isSorted(comparator: Comparator<T>): Boolean 
}
```

By using the type parameter `T`, we ensure that:

* Methods like `get` and `extract` always return elements of the correct type.
* The `insert` method can only accept elements of the same type as the dataset.

**Variance for Flexibility**

Let's focus on the `isSorted` method. It takes a `Comparator<T>`. To provide flexibility in how elements are compared, we can use the `in` variance modifier:

```kotlin
fun isSorted(comparator: Comparator<in T>): Boolean 
```

Why `in` (contravariance)?

* **Subtypes:** If `Animal` is a supertype of `Dog`, then `Comparator<Dog>` is a subtype of `Comparator<Animal>`. This is the essence of contravariance.
* **Flexibility:** With the `in` modifier, we can pass a `Comparator` that works with the dataset's element type or any of its supertypes. This allows for custom sorting logic based on inheritance hierarchies.

**Example**

```kotlin
class Animal(val name: String)
class Dog(name: String, val breed: String) : Animal(name)

val dogDataset = Dataset<Dog>() 
val animalComparator: Comparator<Animal> = compareBy { it.name }

\/\/ This is valid due to contravariance:
dogDataset.isSorted(animalComparator) 
```

**SortingSystem**

The `SortingSystem` needs a slight modification to handle datasets of different types:

```kotlin
class SortingSystem {
  private val datasets: MutableList<Dataset<*>> = mutableListOf()

  fun addDataset(dataset: Dataset<*>) { 
    datasets.add(dataset) 
  }

  \/\/ ... rest of the sorting logic
}
```

The `*` projection is used to indicate that we can have datasets of any type.

**Key Points**

* **Generics:** Provide the foundation for type safety within each `Dataset`.
* **Variance (`in`)** Adds flexibility in how elements can be compared, especially when dealing with type hierarchies.
* **Type Projections (`*`)** Are necessary when working with collections of datasets that might have different element types.

**Let me know if you want to see how specific implementations like `IntegerDataset` or a custom object dataset would look using this design!** 

Response 2:

 Here's how I'd implement the `Dataset` interface to ensure type safety and handle different dataset types in the `SortingSystem`, leveraging Kotlin's generics and variance:

## **Generic `Dataset` Interface**

```kotlin
interface Dataset<out T> {
  fun size(): Int
  fun get(index: Int): T
  fun extract(index: Int): T
  fun insert(index: Int, element: T)
  fun isSorted(comparator: Comparator<T>): Boolean
}
```

- **Type Parameter `T`:** Represents the type of elements in the dataset.
- **`out` Variance:** This is crucial! It means that a `Dataset<Animal>` can be treated as a `Dataset<Dog>` if `Dog` is a subtype of `Animal`. This allows us to store datasets of different but related types in the same `SortingSystem` while maintaining type safety.

## **Custom Implementations**

```kotlin
class IntegerDataset(private val data: List<Int>) : Dataset<Int> {
  \/\/ ... implementation of methods ...
}

class StringDataset(private val data: List<String>) : Dataset<String> {
  \/\/ ... implementation of methods ...
}

\/\/ For custom objects:
class PersonDataset(private val data: List<Person>) : Dataset<Person> {
  \/\/ ... implementation of methods ...
}
```

- Each implementation handles its specific element type, ensuring type safety within dataset operations.

## **`SortingSystem`**

```kotlin
class SortingSystem {
  private val datasets: MutableList<Dataset<*>> = mutableListOf()

  fun <T> addDataset(dataset: Dataset<T>) {
    datasets.add(dataset)
  }

  fun sortAllDatasets(): Int {
    \/\/ ... sorting logic ...
  }
}
```

- **Type Parameter `T` in `addDataset`:** This allows adding datasets of any type while maintaining type safety within the `datasets` list.
- **`Dataset<*>`:** The wildcard `*` is necessary because we don't know the exact type of elements in each dataset beforehand. However, due to the `out` variance in `Dataset`, we can safely:
  - Get elements from any dataset (they'll be of type `Any?`, but we can cast them later if needed).
  - Pass a `Comparator<T>` to `isSorted` for any specific type `T`.

## **Example Usage**

```kotlin
val intDataset = IntegerDataset(listOf(5, 2, 1))
val stringDataset = StringDataset(listOf("Charlie", "Alice", "Bob"))
val personDataset = PersonDataset(listOf(\/* ... *\/))

val system = SortingSystem()
system.addDataset(intDataset)
system.addDataset(stringDataset)
system.addDataset(personDataset)
```

## **Key Points**

- **Type Safety:** The combination of generics and `out` variance ensures that:
  - We can only add datasets of the correct type to `SortingSystem`.
  - Operations within each dataset are type-safe.
- **Flexibility:** We can handle datasets of different types within the same system.
- **Variance:** The `out` modifier is essential for this flexibility. If it were `in`, we wouldn't be able to treat `Dataset<Animal>` as `Dataset<Dog>`, preventing us from storing different dataset types together.

--- Day 6: Chronal Coordinates ---
The device on your wrist beeps several times, and once again you feel like you're falling.

"Situation critical," the device announces. "Destination indeterminate. Chronal interference detected. Please specify new target coordinates."

The device then produces a list of coordinates (your puzzle input). Are they places it thinks are safe or dangerous? It recommends you check manual page 729. The Elves did not give you a manual.

If they're dangerous, maybe you can minimize the danger by finding the coordinate that gives the largest distance from the other points.

Using only the Manhattan distance, determine the area around each coordinate by counting the number of integer X,Y locations that are closest to that coordinate (and aren't tied in distance to any other coordinate).

Your goal is to find the size of the largest area that isn't infinite. For example, consider the following list of coordinates:

1, 1
1, 6
8, 3
3, 4
5, 5
8, 9
If we name these coordinates A through F, we can draw them on a grid, putting 0,0 at the top left:

..........
.A........
..........
........C.
...D......
.....E....
.B........
..........
..........
........F.
This view is partial - the actual grid extends infinitely in all directions. Using the Manhattan distance, each location's closest coordinate can be determined, shown here in lowercase:

aaaaa.cccc
aAaaa.cccc
aaaddecccc
aadddeccCc
..dDdeeccc
bb.deEeecc
bBb.eeee..
bbb.eeefff
bbb.eeffff
bbb.ffffFf
Locations shown as . are equally far from two or more coordinates, and so they don't count as being closest to any.

In this example, the areas of coordinates A, B, C, and F are infinite - while not shown here, their areas extend forever outside the visible grid. However, the areas of coordinates D and E are finite: D is closest to 9 locations, and E is closest to 17 (both including the coordinate's location itself). Therefore, in this example, the size of the largest area is 17.

What is the size of the largest area that isn't infinite?

Your puzzle answer was 4016.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *

--- Part Two ---
On the other hand, if the coordinates are safe, maybe the best you can do is try to find a region near as many coordinates as possible.

For example, suppose you want the sum of the Manhattan distance to all of the coordinates to be less than 32. For each location, add up the distances to all of the given coordinates; if the total of those distances is less than 32, that location is within the desired region. Using the same coordinates as above, the resulting region looks like this:

..........
.A........
..........
...###..C.
..#D###...
..###E#...
.B.###....
..........
..........
........F.
In particular, consider the highlighted location 4,3 located at the top middle of the region. Its calculation is as follows, where abs() is the absolute value function:

Distance to coordinate A: abs(4-1) + abs(3-1) =  5
Distance to coordinate B: abs(4-1) + abs(3-6) =  6
Distance to coordinate C: abs(4-8) + abs(3-3) =  4
Distance to coordinate D: abs(4-3) + abs(3-4) =  2
Distance to coordinate E: abs(4-5) + abs(3-5) =  3
Distance to coordinate F: abs(4-8) + abs(3-9) = 10
Total distance: 5 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 10 = 30
Because the total distance to all coordinates (30) is less than 32, the location is within the region.

This region, which also includes coordinates D and E, has a total size of 16.

Your actual region will need to be much larger than this example, though, instead including all locations with a total distance of less than 10000.

What is the size of the region containing all locations which have a total distance to all given coordinates of less than 10000?

Uses of semaphores
For synchronization
i.e. initiate another task when some event has occurred. E.g. reception of a data byte should trigger processing of the byte.
For mutual exclusion
Allow only one task to use a resource at a time. This called a binary semaphore because it uses only values 0 and 1. It has problem of priority inversion which is solved by Mutex.
For resource management
Sometimes a pool of resources (e.g. N memory buffers) is available and it could be used by upto N tasks. The semaphore keeps a count of user tasks. This is called counting semaphore.

--- Day 13: Mine Cart Madness ---
A crop of this size requires significant logistics to transport produce, soil, fertilizer, and so on. The Elves are very busy pushing things around in carts on some kind of rudimentary system of tracks they've come up with.

Seeing as how cart-and-track systems don't appear in recorded history for another 1000 years, the Elves seem to be making this up as they go along. They haven't even figured out how to avoid collisions yet.

You map out the tracks (your puzzle input) and see where you can help.

Tracks consist of straight paths (| and -), curves (\/ and \), and intersections (+). Curves connect exactly two perpendicular pieces of track; for example, this is a closed loop:

\/----\
|    |
|    |
\----\/
Intersections occur when two perpendicular paths cross. At an intersection, a cart is capable of turning left, turning right, or continuing straight. Here are two loops connected by two intersections:

\/-----\
|     |
|  \/--+--\
|  |  |  |
\--+--\/  |
   |     |
   \-----\/
Several carts are also on the tracks. Carts always face either up (^), down (v), left (<), or right (>). (On your initial map, the track under each cart is a straight path matching the direction the cart is facing.)

Each time a cart has the option to turn (by arriving at any intersection), it turns left the first time, goes straight the second time, turns right the third time, and then repeats those directions starting again with left the fourth time, straight the fifth time, and so on. This process is independent of the particular intersection at which the cart has arrived - that is, the cart has no per-intersection memory.

Carts all move at the same speed; they take turns moving a single step at a time. They do this based on their current location: carts on the top row move first (acting from left to right), then carts on the second row move (again from left to right), then carts on the third row, and so on. Once each cart has moved one step, the process repeats; each of these loops is called a tick.

For example, suppose there are two carts on a straight track:

|  |  |  |  |
v  |  |  |  |

First, the top cart moves. It is facing down (v), so it moves down one square. Second, the bottom cart moves. It is facing up (^), so it moves up one square. Because all carts have moved, the first tick ends. Then, the process repeats, starting with the first cart. The first cart moves down, then the second cart moves up - right into the first cart, colliding with it! (The location of the crash is marked with an X.) This ends the second and last tick.

After following their respective paths for a while, the carts eventually crash. To help prevent crashes, you'd like to know the location of the first crash. Locations are given in X,Y coordinates, where the furthest left column is X=0 and the furthest top row is Y=0:

In this example, the location of the first crash is 7,3.

Your puzzle answer was 130,104.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *

--- Part Two ---
There isn't much you can do to prevent crashes in this ridiculous system. However, by predicting the crashes, the Elves know where to be in advance and instantly remove the two crashing carts the moment any crash occurs.

They can proceed like this for a while, but eventually, they're going to run out of carts. It could be useful to figure out where the last cart that hasn't crashed will end up.

For example:

\/>-<\  
|   |  
| \/<+-\
| | | v

After four very expensive crashes, a tick ends with only one cart remaining; its final location is 6,4.

What is the location of the last cart at the end of the first tick where it is the only cart left?

1 - the process (main thread) will read the grades from a file calles notes.data.txt and store them in a 2-dimensional table dimensional table, with one student per row and one subject per column. The name of the file will be passed as a parameter to main.
- the main thread will then create as many threads as there are columns, each of which will calculate the average score for the column assigned to it.
- each thread stores its average in an array, with the index corresponding to the column assigned to it.
- each thread synchronizes access to its corresponding table element with the main thread with the main thread via a mutex.
- when all threads have completed their calculations, the main thread calculates the overall average and displays the partial and overall averages.
For this exercise, the number of subjects will be set to 4 and the number of students to 10.
The table will be initialized from the text file notes.data on Moodle

hi, we connected an electret directly to an esp-wroom-32 to vcc gnd and whatever the esp32 adc pin is. we used a 10k resistor. declare the variable for the mic input pin, start the serial to capture a series of analog reads from the mic pin, calc the min max values measured in the series of analog reads, calc the delta between the min\/max values. volume of sound, min(4095) max(0) to store the analog reads, fir state that creates a look each time and to calc the vals measured in the 10,000 analog reads etc etc.
Context: You are a competetive programmer. You are given a puzzle to solve using golang.

Write me golang program to solve PART TWO of this puzzle. It needs to read input.txt for its input data.
```
--- Day 21: Scrambled Letters and Hash ---
The computer system you're breaking into uses a weird scrambling function to store its passwords. It shouldn't be much trouble to create your own scrambled password so you can add it to the system; you just have to implement the scrambler.

The scrambling function is a series of operations (the exact list is provided in your puzzle input). Starting with the password to be scrambled, apply each operation in succession to the string. The individual operations behave as follows:

swap position X with position Y means that the letters at indexes X and Y (counting from 0) should be swapped.
swap letter X with letter Y means that the letters X and Y should be swapped (regardless of where they appear in the string).
rotate left\/right X steps means that the whole string should be rotated; for example, one right rotation would turn abcd into dabc.
rotate based on position of letter X means that the whole string should be rotated to the right based on the index of letter X (counting from 0) as determined before this instruction does any rotations. Once the index is determined, rotate the string to the right one time, plus a number of times equal to that index, plus one additional time if the index was at least 4.
reverse positions X through Y means that the span of letters at indexes X through Y (including the letters at X and Y) should be reversed in order.
move position X to position Y means that the letter which is at index X should be removed from the string, then inserted such that it ends up at index Y.
For example, suppose you start with abcde and perform the following operations:

swap position 4 with position 0 swaps the first and last letters, producing the input for the next step, ebcda.
swap letter d with letter b swaps the positions of d and b: edcba.
reverse positions 0 through 4 causes the entire string to be reversed, producing abcde.
rotate left 1 step shifts all letters left one position, causing the first letter to wrap to the end of the string: bcdea.
move position 1 to position 4 removes the letter at position 1 (c), then inserts it at position 4 (the end of the string): bdeac.
move position 3 to position 0 removes the letter at position 3 (a), then inserts it at position 0 (the front of the string): abdec.
rotate based on position of letter b finds the index of letter b (1), then rotates the string right once plus a number of times equal to that index (2): ecabd.
rotate based on position of letter d finds the index of letter d (4), then rotates the string right once, plus a number of times equal to that index, plus an additional time because the index was at least 4, for a total of 6 right rotations: decab.
After these steps, the resulting scrambled password is decab.

Now, you just need to generate a new scrambled password and you can access the system. Given the list of scrambling operations in your puzzle input, what is the result of scrambling abcdefgh?
Your puzzle answer was cbeghdaf.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *

--- Part Two ---
You scrambled the password correctly, but you discover that you can't actually modify the password file on the system. You'll need to un-scramble one of the existing passwords by reversing the scrambling process.

What is the un-scrambled version of the scrambled password fbgdceah?

How do I learn programming as fast as possible?
Respond with only True\/False for each question
1. Semaphores are less powerful than Monitors to achieve mutual exclusion -- 
2. A process that is busy-waiting on a semaphore variable (in wait()) during its time-slice prevents the other process (that is holding the semaphore lock) from doing useful work on single processor systems. -- 
3. The Peterson's solution to the critical section problem achieves both progress and bounded waiting. -- 
4. The TestandSet(mutex) instruction will return "TRUE" if mutex=FALSE. -- 
5. A non-preemptive scheduler cannot context switch a process from the running state to the ready state. --

esp-wroom-32 code to use all 9 features of the gy-80 module. these are the following components. be sure to use any known libraries to keep the code as short as possible (adafruit unified sensor lib might work). All the values output to the serial as a space separated array. these are the following components L3G4200D 3-axis gyroscope, ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer, MC5883L 3-axis magnetometer(heading in degrees, altitude, x, y), BMP085 barometer – thermometer, I2C interface. Include some sort of way to calibrate the sensors in the code. Finally, append a timestamp via wifi for accurate time. When you write the code, start as you want to finish. The sensors need to be read continously via the serial port with putty.

"hi can you give me an example codes of an "Arduino" level system (bytewise integers) and puts the digital signal from 3 digital pdm microphones in the matrix multiplication grid or directly into a 3d array FP8 integers? i need the code to match the workstation specs. the workstation is going to perform the heavy compute. (easier to write cuda kernels for sound data acquisition) the windows 10 workstation has a threadripper 3975wx and a nvidia 4090 gpu. The ESP32 arduino needs to allocate all its resources for data Acquisition. the ESP32 needs to sample the knowles mem mics 7hz-36khz hardware with the lowest latency under 0.5ms, disable watchdog timer if needed. The workstation can use visual studio or python and any libraries. The code needs to scale past 127 microphones once 3 are tested for system compatibility. testing with beam forming but eventually plan to use sonar or music to locate high frequency wave orgins and place a heatmap using cv2"

E.G: three 7khz-36khz mems microphones connected to an esp32. esp32 to connect via mpi cluster wifi to a second esp32. The second esp32 to collect environmental data temp, humidity etc and use bluetooth to send the data reviced via wifi from the DAQ esp32 connected to the 7khz-36khz VIA bluetooth to the windows10 workstation. keep the bytewise matrix multiplication table data for the 3 mics. the work station is going to provide all the heavy compute.

no serial print commands please. this is a is a specalized data aquisition unit. preferably fp8 3d multiplication matrix tables. the microphone is compatible with the esp32. the mic specs handle 7khz-36khz analog,digital pdm and i2s. can disable the wi-fi and bluetooth modues to conserve cpu resources and handle the dma buffer as quickly as possible and using both esp32 cores please? JUST WRITE THE ->!!!ESP32 DATA ACQUISITION PART OF THE CODE PLEASE.!!!<-

Explain the difference between a Semaphore and a Mutex.
1. A given application written in Java runs for 15 seconds on a desktop processor. A new Java compiler is released that requires only 0.6 as many instructions as the old compiler. Unfortunately, it increases the CPI by 1.1. How fast can we expect the application to run using this new compiler?

2. Response time and MIPS are the two metrics computer architects use to define CPU performance? (True\/False)

3. If Machine A is m times faster than Machine B, the relationship between their performances ( perf(A) and perf(B) )and the corresponding execution times ( time(A)  and time(B) ) are given by:
a) perf(A)\/perf(B) = time(B)\/time(A) = 1 - m\/100 
b) perf(A)\/perf(B) = time(B)\/time(A) = m 
c) perf(A)\/perf(B) = time(B)\/time(A) = 1\/m 
d) perf(A)\/perf(B) = time(B)\/time(A) = 1 + m\/100 
Respond with only True\/False for each question
1. Semaphores are less powerful than Monitors to achieve mutual exclusion -- 
2. A process that is busy-waiting on a semaphore variable (in wait()) during its time-slice prevents the other process (that is holding the semaphore lock) from doing useful work on single processor systems. -- 
3. The Peterson's solution to the critical section problem achieves both progress and bounded waiting. -- 
4. The TestandSet(mutex) instruction will return "TRUE" if mutex=FALSE. -- 
5. A non-preemptive scheduler cannot context switch a process from the running state to the ready state. --

--- Day 5: Alchemical Reduction ---
You've managed to sneak in to the prototype suit manufacturing lab. The Elves are making decent progress, but are still struggling with the suit's size reduction capabilities.

While the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their problem eventually, you can do better. You scan the chemical composition of the suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).

The polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed. Units' types are represented by letters; units' polarity is represented by capitalization. For instance, r and R are units with the same type but opposite polarity, whereas r and s are entirely different types and do not react.

For example:

In aA, a and A react, leaving nothing behind.
In abBA, bB destroys itself, leaving aA. As above, this then destroys itself, leaving nothing.
In abAB, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing happens.
In aabAAB, even though aa and AA are of the same type, their polarities match, and so nothing happens.
Now, consider a larger example, dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA:

dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA  The first 'cC' is removed.
dabAaCBAcCcaDA    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.
dabCBAcCcaDA      Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).
dabCBAcaDA        No further actions can be taken.
After all possible reactions, the resulting polymer contains 10 units.

How many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned? (Note: in this puzzle and others, the input is large; if you copy\/paste your input, make sure you get the whole thing.)

Your puzzle answer was 11636.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *

--- Part Two ---
Time to improve the polymer.

One of the unit types is causing problems; it's preventing the polymer from collapsing as much as it should. Your goal is to figure out which unit type is causing the most problems, remove all instances of it (regardless of polarity), fully react the remaining polymer, and measure its length.

For example, again using the polymer dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA from above:

Removing all A\/a units produces dbcCCBcCcD. Fully reacting this polymer produces dbCBcD, which has length 6.
Removing all B\/b units produces daAcCaCAcCcaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daCAcaDA, which has length 8.
Removing all C\/c units produces dabAaBAaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daDA, which has length 4.
Removing all D\/d units produces abAcCaCBAcCcaA. Fully reacting this polymer produces abCBAc, which has length 6.
In this example, removing all C\/c units was best, producing the answer 4.

What is the length of the shortest polymer you can produce by removing all units of exactly one type and fully reacting the result?

What programming language is the most powerful?  If you had to program the largest system ever devised and it had to all exist within one application, what language would you pick?  The application could potentially modify its own code to keep growing to cover more use cases as they are presented by the users of the system.  It needs to be super-efficient and dynamic.  The system you build with it should be capable of being an AI system by the end.

Explain the history of the LMaD forum on Roblox.
Iterate lines in a text file. First launch 32 worker threads. Now in the main thread iterate the lines and send them to a worker thread. If no worker thread is available, block until one becomes available. At the end of the file, wait for all workers to finish with any line they might be currently working. Also tell the workers to shutdown. Wait until all of the workers end. Do it in C#.
i want to implement this:

- maintain the invariant of my class type
- when modifying my class variable through member function, don't directly modify the private object but instead keep tracks of the diffs
- inspect the diffs to check if the changes are valid, if valid then commit the changes to the original object, otherwise discard the diffs

basically i want a transactional mechanism that's efficient (doesn't require deep copy). if it's possible, showcase a very basic example of the implementation, with an invariant rule as simple as "char a must be the first character of std::string b".

1. Semaphores are less powerful than Monitors to achieve mutual exclusion -- 
2. A process that is busy-waiting on a semaphore variable (in wait()) during its time-slice prevents the other process (that is holding the semaphore lock) from doing useful work on single processor systems. -- 
3. The Peterson's solution to the critical section problem achieves both progress and bounded waiting. -- 
4. The TestandSet(mutex) instruction will return "TRUE" if mutex=FALSE. -- 
5. A non-preemptive scheduler cannot context switch a process from the running state to the ready state. --

code for brand new esp-wroom-32s with semaphores, tasks and interrupts for a comprehensive internal systems test (nothing connected to pins). Similar to a workstation or 3d printer POST but tailored specifically to the esp-wroom-32. include core count,clock,ram,etc, etc, etc... . Include a python script that is able to send a "gp" command via the COM3 to get the information.
I expect a fully functional "post" tbh. Add another command(s). The "am" command reads an electret mic plugged into gpio34 on the esp-wroom-32. the command needs 3 functions\/augments."am" command = one output(high+low readings), "am 1" = the esp constantly outputs the high\/low every second to the serial port. "am 0" = the esp stops outputting the high\/low every second to the serial port. The python code needs to be a simple terminal such as a chat interface.

Create a red-black tree in Java. The tree should implement all the Java Map interface methods and be fully generic for both keys and values.  It is critical that all methods are fully implemented, no method should be output as a stub to be filled in later.  Also the first method to be output is "remove".

--- Day 5: Alchemical Reduction ---
You've managed to sneak in to the prototype suit manufacturing lab. The Elves are making decent progress, but are still struggling with the suit's size reduction capabilities.

While the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their problem eventually, you can do better. You scan the chemical composition of the suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).

The polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed. Units' types are represented by letters; units' polarity is represented by capitalization. For instance, r and R are units with the same type but opposite polarity, whereas r and s are entirely different types and do not react.

For example:

In aA, a and A react, leaving nothing behind.
In abBA, bB destroys itself, leaving aA. As above, this then destroys itself, leaving nothing.
In abAB, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing happens.
In aabAAB, even though aa and AA are of the same type, their polarities match, and so nothing happens.
Now, consider a larger example, dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA:

dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA  The first 'cC' is removed.
dabAaCBAcCcaDA    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.
dabCBAcCcaDA      Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).
dabCBAcaDA        No further actions can be taken.
After all possible reactions, the resulting polymer contains 10 units.

How many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned? (Note: in this puzzle and others, the input is large; if you copy\/paste your input, make sure you get the whole thing.)

Your puzzle answer was 11636.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *

--- Part Two ---
Time to improve the polymer.

One of the unit types is causing problems; it's preventing the polymer from collapsing as much as it should. Your goal is to figure out which unit type is causing the most problems, remove all instances of it (regardless of polarity), fully react the remaining polymer, and measure its length.

For example, again using the polymer dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA from above:

Removing all A\/a units produces dbcCCBcCcD. Fully reacting this polymer produces dbCBcD, which has length 6.
Removing all B\/b units produces daAcCaCAcCcaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daCAcaDA, which has length 8.
Removing all C\/c units produces dabAaBAaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daDA, which has length 4.
Removing all D\/d units produces abAcCaCBAcCcaA. Fully reacting this polymer produces abCBAc, which has length 6.
In this example, removing all C\/c units was best, producing the answer 4.

What is the length of the shortest polymer you can produce by removing all units of exactly one type and fully reacting the result?

hi can you give me an example codes of an "Arduino" level system (bytewise integers) and puts the digital signal from 3 digital pdm microphones in the matrix multiplication grid or directly into a 3d array? i need the code to match the workstation specs. the workstation is going to perform the heavy compute. (easier to write cuda kernels for sound data acquisition) the windows 10 workstation has a threadripper 3975wx and a nvidia 4090 gpu. The ESP32 arduino needs to allocate all its resources for data Acquisition. the ESP32 "arduino" needs to sample the knowles mem mics 7hz-36khz hardware with the lowest latency under 0.5ms, disable watchdog timer if needed. The workstation can use python and any libraries.

E.G: three 7khz-36khz mems microphones connected to an esp32. i want the esp32 to connect via mpi wifi to a second esp32. i want the second esp32 to use bluetooth to send the data reviced via wifi from the DAQ esp32 connected to the 7khz-36khz VIA bluetooth to the windows10 workstation. keep the bytewise matrix multiplication table data for the 3 mics. the work station is going to provide all the heavy compute.

--- Day 16: Chronal Classification ---
As you see the Elves defend their hot chocolate successfully, you go back to falling through time. This is going to become a problem.

If you're ever going to return to your own time, you need to understand how this device on your wrist works. You have a little while before you reach your next destination, and with a bit of trial and error, you manage to pull up a programming manual on the device's tiny screen.

According to the manual, the device has four registers (numbered 0 through 3) that can be manipulated by instructions containing one of 16 opcodes. The registers start with the value 0.

Every instruction consists of four values: an opcode, two inputs (named A and B), and an output (named C), in that order. The opcode specifies the behavior of the instruction and how the inputs are interpreted. The output, C, is always treated as a register.

In the opcode descriptions below, if something says "value A", it means to take the number given as A literally. (This is also called an "immediate" value.) If something says "register A", it means to use the number given as A to read from (or write to) the register with that number. So, if the opcode addi adds register A and value B, storing the result in register C, and the instruction addi 0 7 3 is encountered, it would add 7 to the value contained by register 0 and store the sum in register 3, never modifying registers 0, 1, or 2 in the process.

Many opcodes are similar except for how they interpret their arguments. The opcodes fall into seven general categories:

Addition:

addr (add register) stores into register C the result of adding register A and register B.
addi (add immediate) stores into register C the result of adding register A and value B.
Multiplication:

mulr (multiply register) stores into register C the result of multiplying register A and register B.
muli (multiply immediate) stores into register C the result of multiplying register A and value B.
Bitwise AND:

banr (bitwise AND register) stores into register C the result of the bitwise AND of register A and register B.
bani (bitwise AND immediate) stores into register C the result of the bitwise AND of register A and value B.
Bitwise OR:

borr (bitwise OR register) stores into register C the result of the bitwise OR of register A and register B.
bori (bitwise OR immediate) stores into register C the result of the bitwise OR of register A and value B.
Assignment:

setr (set register) copies the contents of register A into register C. (Input B is ignored.)
seti (set immediate) stores value A into register C. (Input B is ignored.)
Greater-than testing:

gtir (greater-than immediate\/register) sets register C to 1 if value A is greater than register B. Otherwise, register C is set to 0.
gtri (greater-than register\/immediate) sets register C to 1 if register A is greater than value B. Otherwise, register C is set to 0.
gtrr (greater-than register\/register) sets register C to 1 if register A is greater than register B. Otherwise, register C is set to 0.
Equality testing:

eqir (equal immediate\/register) sets register C to 1 if value A is equal to register B. Otherwise, register C is set to 0.
eqri (equal register\/immediate) sets register C to 1 if register A is equal to value B. Otherwise, register C is set to 0.
eqrr (equal register\/register) sets register C to 1 if register A is equal to register B. Otherwise, register C is set to 0.
Unfortunately, while the manual gives the name of each opcode, it doesn't seem to indicate the number. However, you can monitor the CPU to see the contents of the registers before and after instructions are executed to try to work them out. Each opcode has a number from 0 through 15, but the manual doesn't say which is which. For example, suppose you capture the following sample:

Before: [3, 2, 1, 1]
9 2 1 2
After:  [3, 2, 2, 1]
This sample shows the effect of the instruction 9 2 1 2 on the registers. Before the instruction is executed, register 0 has value 3, register 1 has value 2, and registers 2 and 3 have value 1. After the instruction is executed, register 2's value becomes 2.

The instruction itself, 9 2 1 2, means that opcode 9 was executed with A=2, B=1, and C=2. Opcode 9 could be any of the 16 opcodes listed above, but only three of them behave in a way that would cause the result shown in the sample:

Opcode 9 could be mulr: register 2 (which has a value of 1) times register 1 (which has a value of 2) produces 2, which matches the value stored in the output register, register 2.
Opcode 9 could be addi: register 2 (which has a value of 1) plus value 1 produces 2, which matches the value stored in the output register, register 2.
Opcode 9 could be seti: value 2 matches the value stored in the output register, register 2; the number given for B is irrelevant.
None of the other opcodes produce the result captured in the sample. Because of this, the sample above behaves like three opcodes.

You collect many of these samples (the first section of your puzzle input). The manual also includes a small test program (the second section of your puzzle input) - you can ignore it for now.

Ignoring the opcode numbers, how many samples in your puzzle input behave like three or more opcodes?
