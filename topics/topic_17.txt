how many ways can you run containers in AWS?
LLDP protocol is used to discover neighboring network devices. Running "lldp neighbor" command on a computer, which is connected to a normal managed switch, allows discovering which switch port is used to connect the computer, making it possible to detect computers plugged to wrong or unexpected ports. OpenWRT firmware for router\/switch allows running lldp server, but by default, running lldp neighbor on a computer connected to OpenWRT does not show which OpenWRT router's port is used for the connection. OpenWRT router usually has a SOC with one or two ethernet ports, majorty of physical ports are handled by internal managed switch which is configuer using "swconfig" or "DSA" from OpenWRT firmware running on the switch. Is there a way to configure OpenWRT router\/switch to reply to lldp request with information about which physical port was used to receive that lldp request ?

Craft an efficient Bash script that uses Nmap and other default Kali Linux tools to quickly discover all routable hosts within the entire RFC1918 IP space, considering multiple VLANs and varying CIDR networks. The script should work under the assumption that it operates within an RFC1918 network but lacks specific subnet details. While the focus is on host detection, port scanning of common ports may be utilized to supplement host discovery. The final output should be a list of unique IP addresses, sorted using the command sort -uV. The operation of the script should be as expedited as possible, for instance, implementing nmap's --min-rate option. Explain the specific commands and syntaxes involved, and demonstrate how to construct an advanced network scanning technique that optimizes speed and efficiency.
