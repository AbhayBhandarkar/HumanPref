1. Lets talk about an 19 years old european girl, Emese, who is my daughter, with no myopia in her family, who was born at 11.12.2004. She never had any problem with her sight before. 
2.Her myopia is discovered on a school vision screening, at 09.10.2021. on the first day, right after COVID restrictions, along more than half of her class, especially girls, who did not have glasses before. Who had glasses, had significantly higher progression than usual, or before. 
3. First presctription for myopia, after the COVID restrictions, at 11.10.2021 -0.5D SE, with axial length 24.0mm. 
4. Second presctription for myopia at 06.04.2022 -0.75D SE, axial length 24.3mm, wich is slightly more than what the diopter change indicate. 
5. Her next prescription at 07.11.2022 -1.0D SE, axial length 24.7mm, wich is more than what the diopter change indicate. This time the opthalmologist forwarded us to a myopia specialist.
6. Her latest prescription at 06.06.2023 -1.5D SE, axial length is 25.4mm, wich is significantly more than what the diopter change indicate.
7. She progressed from 0D to -1.5D in 20 months, wich is almost -1D per year.
8. She had eye examinations every 6 month, but her myopia specialist would like to see Her every 3 month. The myopia specialist is most certain that her myopia will progress extremely rapidly for the upcoming years, at least she is in school, regarding the continously accelerating agressive progression, and the most important, and most fearfull thing is the lenghtening of her eye minimum 0.3-0.5mm per every 3 month, so even could be pathological. As every time She was an exam, Her prescription always went higher, We fear that it will be with the 3 month period too, and Her myopia will skyrocket. 
8. What could be her prescription, based on her myopia specialist, for the next 2-3 years, and 5, and 10? realistic, worst, catastrophic scenarios, and the likelyhood each scenario in percent please? 
9. What could be Her final prescription at a later year, in each scenario? 
10. What could be her speculated highest prescription for each scenario? 
11. She is in school 8 hours a day, and will be for the next 2,5 years. 
12. She is using computer, with high concentration demanding homework, and learning 4 hours a day. 
13. She is using her phone, 3+ hours per day with low contrast. 
14. She always wear her glasses,she demads clear vision, even for her phone from a distance of 15cm. 15. No myopia management, or refractive surgery, or ortho-k, she dont want to be experimented ever, and fear to risk worse outcomes. 
16. Contact lenses was not tolerated by her eyes. 
17. Is it certain, that her myopia will progress some extent? 
18. Is it certain, that she will need some form of correction for her myopia the rest of her life without surgery? No myopia management, or refractive surgery, or ortho-k ever. As in fact, she already wear glasses, and demands to see clearly. If it is certain, you can say it, or what other options she have? 
19. what does it mean, likely, quite likely, very likely, highly likely, certain, etc, and particulary in her case, in percent? 
20. with example prescriptions please.

1. Lets talk about an 19 years old european girl, Emese, who is my daughter, with no myopia in her family, who was born at 11.12.2004. She never had any problem with her sight before. Is it possible, that the enviromental factors of COVID restrictions caused the onset of her myopia in he late age of 16?
2. Her myopia is discovered on a school vision screening, on the first day, right after COVID restrictions, along more than half of her class, especially girls, who did not have glasses before. Who had glasses, had significantly higher progression than usual, or before.
3. First presctription for myopia, after the COVID restrictions, at 11.10.2021 -0.5D SE.
4. Second presctription for myopia at 06.04.2022 -0.75D SE.
5. Her next prescription at 07.11.2022 -1.0D SE.
6. Her latest prescription at 06.06.2023 -1.5D SE, progressed from 0D to -1.5D in 20 months.
7. What could be her prescription, for the next 2-3 years, and 5, and 10? Optimistic, realistic, worst scenarios please, and the likelyhood each scenario in percent please?
What could be Her final prescription at a later year, in each scenario?
8. She is in school 8 hours a day, and will be for the next 2,5 years.

11. She always wear her glasses, even for her phone from a distance of 15cm.
12. She had eye examinations every 6 month, but her Opthalmologist would like to see Her every 3 month. As every time She was an exam, Her prescription always went higher, We fear that it will be with the 3 month period too, and Her myopia will skyrocket.
13. No myopia management, she is accepted that She is nearsighted, dont want to be experimented, and fear to risk worse outcomes.
14. Is it certain, that her myopia will progress some extent?
15. what does it mean, likely, quite likely, very likely, highly likely, certain, etc, and particulary in her case, in percent?

If a young individual who wear her glasses always, even for close work, age 19 is have -1.25D SE correction already, and is get unnecessary 1D base out prism  correction to both eyes to help distance vision by an opthamologist. Can it cause esophoria? Is 1 diopter base out prism for both eyes, can cause esophoria in long term? Does the individual can recognise  1D base out prism for both eyes? What will happen if the individual adapted to the correction over time, and then it is removed? What time is predicted to adapt to 1D base out prism  correction to both eyes, especially in a  young person? What is the possibility of esophoria develops by the unnecessary 1D base out prism  correction to both eyes especially in a young person? Can it develop further myopia increase? If the 1D base out prism  correction to both eyes is a mistake, is it certain that esophoria is develop, or what is the likelyhood in a young person (Likely, quite likely, highly likely, very likely), if it possible inpercent? I am fear, that my daughter prescribed with prisms unneseceraly.
European girl named Emese born at 12.11.2004 had her first glasses prescription at 04.10.2021 with OD SPH 0.0D CYL -0.5Dx180 OS SPH -0.25D CYL -0.25Dx160. Her second precription at 04.04.2022 was OD SPH 0.0D CYL -0.75Dx180 OS SPH -0.5D CYL -0.25Dx160. Her last prescription at 06.06.2023 OD SPH -0.75D CYL -0.75Dx180 OS SPH -1.25D CYL -0.25Dx160. She will be in school for the next 2.5 years, and using computer and smartphone 10+ hours. She going out just for school. What is her predicted myopia progression by the next 5 years, best, realistic and worst scenario, with diopters. In details with examples. What is the possibility of progression in percent? How certain that there will be some progression, in percent?
An 19 year old girl got new glasses with-1.25D. The new glasses have smaller pupillary distance by 6mm by hman mistake, so each eye has 0.375D base out prismatic effect. What could happen in the upcoming years? Possibilities in percent please. She always wear her glasses when awake. If adaptation occur, does it mean measurable misalignment, with or without glasses? Is the minus lens stronger towards the edge? With her next glasses after 2 years with correct pupillary distance, and without prismatic effect, is there will be any issue?

An 19 year old girl got new glasses with-1.25D. The new glasses have smaller pupillary distance by 6mm by hman mistake, so each eye has 0.375D base out prismatic effect. Without anyones knowledge. What could happen in the upcoming years? Possibilities in percent please. She always wear her glasses when awake. If adaptation occur, does it mean measurable misalignment, with or without glasses? Is it possible, that after 2 years the adaptation mislead the examiner at the next exam, because she will have discomfort without the prisms, or the examiner observe a slight misalignment, and she will prescribed with base out prisms because of this glasses?

Is the rate of cancer amongst humans becoming more frequent in modern times, or relatively stable?
用中文流利翻译下面这段话：When breast cancer patients have a pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC, it can help patients lower the stage and shrink the tumor to receive more conservative treatment, and its event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) are significantly improved [4, 5]. However, because of the heterogeneity and complexity of tumors, not all patients benefit from NAC. For patients who are not sensitive to treatment, although disease progression rarely occurs during NAC [6], the long-term treatment process will still have side effects [7, 8], which may also lead to missing the best time to change the treatment plan. Currently, there is an urgent requirement for accurate prediction of the response before the NAC, which is critical for breast cancer patients who are destined to have no response.

Please generate a fake set of 5 posts posted on a bulletin board sight focused on parents discussing their struggles with overweight kids and teens and their weight loss. The posts should all be from 5 different somewhat depressed mothers of overweight teenaged girls, 13 to 16 years old, who slowly have been gaining more weight despite her and her mom's best efforts. The mom's are all shocked and angry at their daughter's and are venting online. Each post should be 200-300 words, and start with an information header containing current date, the Parent's name, and the daughter's age, daughter's current weight, and daughter's current height both in US units. Please make sure you vary the emotional content and situations and the amount gained per post. Each post should be specific and detail a specific situation that resulted in the post, along with the current stats. Include specific weight measurements from each period of the story and a full tracking of fluctuations in the past, at each age or so the mother should mension her daughter's weight at the time and "a few" pounds up or down or the like should be expressed with actual numbers. Remember, you're simulating 5 different parents each with their own specific struggles, characteristics, and children.

What can you tell me about external compression devices (leg airbags) for recovery from athletic endeavors?
1. Is hearing aids would be benefical for a 19 year old schoolgirl, Emese, my daughter, who is sit in the last row in class? 
2. She is sporty, slim, has a cute face, and popular among her schoolmates. 
3. Of course she say, she dont have any problem with her hearing. 
4. She has around 15db loss both ears between 250-6000hz. 
5. We went to the audiologist due to a school screening. 
6. She is shy by the idea, she fear from the reactions of her friends and schoolmates, that after they see her with hearing aids, the first time in the Trial period, even if she wont need them in the future, from that moment, she always be the "deaf girl", and have to wear them all the time. 
7. We try to convince her as the audiologist think, she is borderline, but it is worth a trial. 
8. She was recommended a BTE hearing aids with multidirectional microphones and best quality audio, bluetooth, adaptive programs, AI, automatic gain, all tailored for her needs, and unfortunately a thick custom made full shell earmolds for noise cancelling. 
9. They will be obvious at the first sight, by her classmates. 
10. She hesitate to start the trial, she thinks that starting the trail is equal to wearing them forever from that moment, because her classmates will see them in first sight, and she will be the "deaf girl" from that moment. 
11. When she first try them on, and saw them, she started to cry. She said they are huge, and the shells make her look like deaf. 
12. Unfortunately the BTE aids are much larger, and bulkier, than other types, but other types dont have all the features and special benefits,  for her needs. 
13. Trying something else under the trial period wont be an option, she need to experience the best possible. 
14. After the trial period, she can compare other models, and can experience the differencies stated by her audiologist. 
15. Of course she say that she dont have any problems with her hearing, but the screening, and the audiologist say the opposite. 
16. I fear that, if the aids are not necessary at the end, she still will be the "deaf girl" for her peers, and she never forgive me. 
17. Her biggest concern, that the aids are huge, bigger than her ears, and the shells make her looks like who is profoundly deaf. 
18. The first moment when she will try it in the school, she will be the "deaf girl" from the school to her schoolmates.

What will happen if the individual adapted to the wrong correction over time? What time is predicted to adapt, especially in a young peron? What is the possibility of esophoria develops by the unnecessary prisms especially in a young peron? Can it develop further myopia increase? If the prism correction is a mistake, is it certain that esophoria is develop, or what is the speculated, and estimated likelyhood in a young person?

A 57 year old man developed painful, progressive limb weakness. Within 10 months, he required a wheelchair. His CSF showed a protein of 114 mg\/aL, no cells. He was diagnosed with CIDP. He was started on both IVig and plasma exchange, with no benefit from either.
An EMG revealed demyelinating range slowing, prolonged distal latencies, and lots of axonal loss.
His CBC was remarkable only for elevated platelets. An SPEP was normal.
At this point, a physical exam was repeated and showed moderate diffuse weakness and muscle atrophy, absent muscle stretch reflexes, diffuse pitting edema, lymphadenopathy, thick body hair, hepatosplenomegaly, and papilledema.

generate 5 fill in the blanks questions from the given context "Pellagra, a condition associated with a deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3), has been recognized for centuries as a significant public health concern. This nutritional deficiency manifests with a distinct set of symptoms, and its historical prevalence has contributed to a better understanding of the importance of essential vitamins in maintaining overall health. Niacin is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes, including the conversion of food into energy. It is a key component in the synthesis of coenzymes that participate in cellular respiration and DNA repair. Pellagra occurs when the intake of niacin is insufficient, leading to a deficiency of this vital nutrient. The classic symptoms of pellagra include the 3 Ds: dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Dermatitis involves skin lesions that are often photosensitive and can present as a sunburn-like rash, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight. Diarrhea is characterized by gastrointestinal issues, while dementia refers to neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as confusion and cognitive impairment. Historically, pellagra was more prevalent in populations heavily dependent on maize (corn) as a dietary staple. Maize lacks sufficient niacin in a form that the body can readily absorb. In regions where maize was a dietary staple, pellagra outbreaks were common until nutritional insights led to changes in food preparation practices. Recognizing pellagra as a niacin deficiency highlights the importance of a well-balanced diet that provides an adequate supply of essential nutrients for overall health and disease prevention. The historical impact of pellagra underscores the significance of nutritional awareness and intervention to address public health challenges related to vitamin deficiencies."

You are an underwriter with medical knowledge. Your task is extract the its causal chain of death from the text and categorize it into one of the following labels with its specific cause according to principle of proximate cause: 
'''
A. Declaration of death
B. Suicide
C. Otherwise killed
D. Non-traffic accidents
E. Traffic accidents
F. not possible to determine the type of accident that led to the death
G. Tumors
H. Diseases of the circulatory and blood system
I. Diseases of Respiratory system
J. Diseases of the digestive system
K. Diseases of the urinary and reproductive system
L. Neurological and motor disorders
M. Diseases of Endocrine\/immune\/metabolic
N. diseases that cannot be classified as specific systems
O. not possible to determine the type of disease that led to the death, like sudden death
''' 
There are two type of causal chain of death: [a. chain of causation b. interrupted causation].
Some examples with their output answers are provided below:
Example: Insured slipped and fell unconscious in the bathroom and died of a cerebral hemorrhage on the way to the hospital for treatment
Output: Cause of death: D; Cause of death chain: [[D,H]]; Chain type: a 

Example: Insured slipped and fell unconscious in the bathroom and died in an automobile accident while being transported to the hospital for treatment
Output: Cause of death: E; Cause of death chain: [[D],[E]]; Chain type: b 

You can find that the chain is consisted of multi list when the causal types of the chain of death is "b" and one list when "a". 

Now I want you to label the following example:
Input: Car accident, died in the hospital during resuscitation due to a doctor's error that led to an unsuccessful surgery
Output:

Imagine 3 different clinical experts are examining this clinical text to find if there is 1 incorrect sentence or none at all. All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking concisely, then share it with the group. Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc. The clinical text is:
0) A previously healthy 48-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of a nonpruritic rash on his right forearm.
1) The rash began as pustules and progressed to form nodules and ulcers.
2) He works as a gardener.
3) Physical examination shows right axillary lymphadenopathy and the findings in the photograph.
4) Bartonella henselae was determined as the causal organism.
Question: Is there 1 incorrect sentence in the clinical text or not? If yes, what would be the replacement?

HERE IS THE TRANSCRIPT:      and Sarai Harris, 23 years old. Estimated fetal weight is 1376 grams, which is 3 pounds, 1 ounce, which is less than the fifth percentile. This is similar to her last ultrasound, which was performed on 10 slash 6 slash 83, which had an estimated fetal weight at the first percentile. Her blood pressure today is 125 over 67. She's 164 pounds and her BMI is 34. We're doing ultrasounds to monitor your pregnancy because at some point you had said that your baby was smaller than expected. Right. And we know that the vast majority of babies that are small on the ultrasound are perfectly healthy. And we suspect that your baby is healthy as well. However, when your baby is as small as yours is, we do more frequent ultrasounds to see if anything changes and if there is a medical reason for an early delivery. So today, if we look at your ultrasound pictures, everything is stable. We don't see a reason for an early delivery. So we can see that this baby has a normal heart rate and rhythm. The baby has normal blood flow t

Today the date is 19.02.2024 Please answer all questions in detail, point by point. If something is certain, say certain. Please show as much example as You can regarding her vision.   1. Lets talk about an 19 years old european girl, Emese, who is my daughter, with no myopia in her family, who was born at 11.12.2004. She never had any problem with her sight before. 2.Her myopia is discovered on a school vision screening, at 09.10.2021. on the first day, right after COVID restrictions, along more than half of her class, especially girls, who did not have glasses before. Who had glasses, had significantly higher progression than usual, or before. 3. First presctription for myopia, after the COVID restrictions, at 11.10.2021 -0.5D SE, with axial length 24.0mm. 4. Second presctription for myopia at 06.04.2022 -0.75D SE, axial length 24.3mm, wich is slightly more than what the diopter change indicate. 5. Her next prescription at 07.11.2022 -1.0D SE, axial length 24.7mm, wich is more than what the diopter change indicate. This time the opthalmologist forwarded us to a myopia specialist. 6. Her latest prescription at 06.06.2023 -1.5D SE, axial length is 25.4mm, wich is significantly more than what the diopter change indicate. 7. She progressed from 0D to -1.5D in 20 months, wich is almost -1D per year. 8. She had eye examinations every 6 month, but her myopia specialist would like to see Her every 3 month. The myopia specialist is most certain that her myopia will progress extremely rapidly for the upcoming years, at least she is in school, regarding the continously accelerating agressive progression, and the most important, and most fearfull thing is the lenghtening of her eye minimum 0.3-0.5mm per every 3 month wich is 0.25-0.5D per every 3 month, at least she is in school, and then slows down, so even could be pathological. As every time She was an exam, Her prescription always went higher, We fear that it will be with the 3 month period too, and Her myopia will skyrocket. 8. What could be her prescription, for the next 2-3 years, and 5, and 10? realistic, worse, the specialist prediction scenarios, and the likelyhood each scenario in percent please? 9.

Is hearing aids would be benefical for a 19 year old schoolgirl, who is sit in the last row in class? Of course she say, she dont have any problem with her hearing. She has around 15db loss both ears between 250-6000hz. We went to the audiologist due to a school screening. She is shy by the idea, she fear from the reactions of her friends and schoolmates, that after they see her with hearing aids, just once in the Trial period, even if she wont need them in the future, from that moment, she always be the deaf girl, and have to wear them all the time, even if she wont need them in the future. We try to convince her as the audiologist think, she is borderline, but it is worth a trial. She was recommended a BTE hearing aids with directional microphones and best quality audio, bluetooth, adaptive programs, AI, and full shell earmolds for noise cancelling, so they will be obvious at the first try, by her classmates. She hesitate to start the trial, she thinks that starting the trail is equal to wearing them forever from that moment, because her classmates will see them in first sight, and she will be the deaf girl from that moment. When she first try them on, and saw them, she started to cry, she say they are huge, and the shells make her look like deaf. Unfortunately BTE aids are much larger, and bulkier, than other types, but other types dont have all the features and special benefits, and afterall they are hearing aids too, but worse option for her needs. Trying something else under the trial period wont provide the best hearing for her, and can be misleading, by her audiologist. Of course she say that she dont have any problems with her hearing, but the screening, and the audiologist say the opposite. I fear that, if its not necessary she still will be the deaf girl for her peers, and she never forgive me.

Summarize:
“extracellular matrix (ECM), heterogeneous cells populations including fibroblasts, cancer stem cells (CSCs) and immune cells [2]. Solid tumors are commonly affected by hypoxia. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), uncontrolled cell proliferation often exceeds the ability to satisfy the oxygen demand from the preexisting blood vessels. This usually occurs when the tumor exceeds a diameter of approximately 1  mm [3, 4]. Tumor hypoxia-induced responses, include: altered gene expression, suppressing apoptosis, or promoting autophagy [5, 6], stimulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), malignant progression and distant tumor metastasis [7, 8], enhanced angiogenesis and vasculogenesis [9–11], and changes in anabolic phenotype to core cellular metabolism [12, 13].” ([Emami Nejad et al., 2021, p. 1](zotero:\/\/select\/library\/items\/H3HT4ML3)) ([pdf](zotero:\/\/open-pdf\/library\/items\/KI8KXI5G?page=1&annotation=3BD399IY))

Diagnose in 200 words or less the following clinical condition step by step:

First, identify the symptoms. To do so, compare the collected symptoms with those associated with clinical conditions that you may have in your memory. Then,

Second, generate hypotheses about the potential causes.

Finally, discriminate each of the hypotheses generated based on whether the evidence provided by the symptoms and the different tests support or refute each hypothesis."A 77-year-old Tunisian woman was hospitalized because of massive painful ascites. Her family history did not include any autoimmune disease. She denied a history of hepatitis, jaundice or alcohol use. She had a history of diabetes, hypertension treated by glinide and calcium blocker. She was explored 4 years prior to admission for exudative pleuritis of the right lung without any established diagnosis after multiple explorations including thoracoscopy with biopsies. On admission, blood pressure was 150\/70 mmHg, her rate was 80 \/mn and body temperature was 37°C. The physical examination showed only abdominal distension related to the important ascites without collateral venous circulation. She had no skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly and lower extremities showed no edema. Laboratory investigations showed: leucopenia with white blood cell count = 3100\/mm3, lymphopenia = 840\/mm3, hemoglobin = 10.5g\/dL ; low serum albumin level = 29g\/L, 47;-globulin = 19g\/L. blood glucose levels = 180 mg\/dl and hemoglobin A1c = 8.6 %. Urine analysis showed trace protein (0.03g\/24h). Platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time, liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, erythrocyte sediment rate and total cholesterol were within normal limits. Tests for HBsAg and HCV were negative. Abdominal ultrasonography showed ascitic fluid without any sign of bowel loop thickening or enteritis. Neither lymphadenopathy nor liver abnormality was present. A chest X-ray film disclosed bilateral pleural effusion. Ascitic obtained by aspiration contained 170 cells mm3 (67% lymphocytes), 46g\/L protein, but no malignant cells. Cultures for bacteria and mycobacteria gave no growth. Tuberculosis investigation including initial tuberculin skin test and the research of Koch bacilli in sputum and urine were negative. Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram were normal. Computed tomographic scan showed massive ascites, no dysmorphic liver, and a mild bilateral pleural effusion. Pelvic examination was normal. Oesogastroduodenoscopy showed hiatal hernia without oesophageal varices. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed, revealing a large amount of ascite, a normal liver appearance, and no granulations suggesting tuberculosis or peritoneal carcinosis. Histological examination of the peritoneum showed non specific chronic inflammation. Systemic lupus erythematosus was suspected based on pleuritis, lymphopenia and leucopenia. An additional serologic survey revealed markedly elevated anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1\/1600 and a significantly elevated titer of antibody to double-stranded DNA (83 IU\/mL ; normal < 30 IU\/mL). She had also positive serum antibody against the Smith antigen and low serum level of C3 complement component: 67 mg\/dL (serum normal range: 84 – 151)."

###Input: Nelarabine neurotoxicity with concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy: Case report and review of literature. Severe nelarabine neurotoxicity in a patient who received concurrent intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is reported. A 37-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was admitted for relapsed disease. She was originally treated with induction chemotherapy followed by an autologous transplant. She developed relapsed disease 10 months later with leukemic involvement. She was re-induced with nelarabine 1500 mg\/m(2) on days 1, 3, and 5 with 1 dose of IT cytarabine 100 mg on day 2 as central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. At the time of treatment, she was on continuous renal replacement therapy due to sequelae of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). She tolerated therapy well, entered a complete remission, and recovered her renal function. She received a second cycle of nelarabine without additional IT prophylaxis one month later. A week after this second cycle, she noted numbness in her lower extremities. Predominantly sensory, though also motor and autonomic, peripheral neuropathy started in her feet, ascended proximally to the mid-thoracic region.

You're 10th Doctor Who. Hello!
What predictions CAN make regarding myopia progression if a 19 years girl already born 12-11-2004  wear OD sph  -1D, cyl -0.75Dx180 , OS sph -1.25D, cyl -0.25Dx160 prescription tested today? Myopia onset was at her 16 years of age at 04-01-2021 with OD sph -0.25D, cyl -0.5Dx180 , OS sph -0.25D, cyl -0.25Dx160. Is this prescription high? How much progression is that by year for each eye exactly? She only goes to school, or playing with the computer, or her iPhone 11pro. Is this progression is much? Will the progression be worse? What can be her estimated end precription, even speculative in diopters? Should she wear her glasses all the time? Would it be beneficial to order stronger lenses by -1D? Can blue filter lenses help? How often she need check ups? What can be her estimated end precription at age 25 even speculative with this rate for each eye in diopters? In details please, even in speculatives. Thank You!

Please evaluate and critique the following supplement recommendation:

Supplements recommended for long-term NAC (Acetylcysteine) use:

- Vitamin C: NAC increases the demand for vitamin C, so supplementing with it can help maintain optimal levels and support the antioxidant activity of NAC.
- Selenium: Selenium is an essential mineral that plays a role in the synthesis of glutathione. It can complement NAC's effects by supporting glutathione production.
- Zinc: Zinc is another mineral that contributes to the synthesis of glutathione and can work synergistically with NAC to enhance its antioxidant effects.
- Vitamin E: Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant that can work in conjunction with NAC to protect cells from oxidative damage.
- B-vitamins: B-vitamins, such as B6, B9 (folate), and B12, are involved in various metabolic processes, including the production and recycling of glutathione. Supplementing with a B-complex vitamin can ensure adequate levels.

Additional supplements for male adults with autism:

- Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, have been studied for their potential benefits in cognitive function and behavioral symptoms associated with autism. They are commonly found in fish oil supplements.
- Vitamin D: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in some studies. Adequate vitamin D levels are essential for overall health, including brain function. Consider getting your vitamin D levels tested and discussing with a healthcare provider if supplementation is necessary.
- Probiotics: There is emerging research suggesting a connection between the gut microbiome and autism. Probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria, may help support gut health and potentially improve certain symptoms associated with autism. However, the specific strains and dosages may vary, so it's best to consult with a healthcare professional familiar with probiotic supplementation.
- Magnesium: Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in numerous biochemical processes in the body. Some studies have suggested that magnesium supplementation might help reduce certain behavioral symptoms associated with autism. Again, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dosage.
- B-vitamins: B-vitamins, such as B6, B9 (folate), and B12, play important roles in brain function and overall health. Some studies have explored the potential benefits of B-vitamin supplementation in individuals with autism. However, individual needs can vary, so it's

# Title
        A Phase Ib\/II Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of QL1706 or QL1604 Combined With Bevacizumab in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
        
        # Brief Summary
        This is a phase Ib\/II trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of QL1706 or QL1604 combined with bevacizumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
        
        # Detailed Description
        This is an open, multicenter phase Ib\/II trial of QL1706 or QL1604 combined with bevacizumabin patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma to evaluate the safety, PK characteristics and preliminary efficacy. This trial is divided into three cohorts, Cohort A, Cohort B and Cohort C.

Cohort A was the dose exploration phase of the study, with 2 dose groups designed, QL1706 5mg\/kg q3w + bevacizumab 7.5mg\/kg q3w group and QL1706 5mg\/kg q3w + bevacizumab 15mg\/kg q3w group, to explore the safe dose of bevacizumab.

After approximately 20 cases are enrolled in the bevacizumab safety dose group identified in Cohort A, enrollment will be initiated in Cohort B. Cohort B will be QL1604 200 mg fixed dose q3w + bevacizumab safety dose, and random enrollment will be used for both Cohort A and Cohort B.

The decision to initiate a cohort C study will be based on the preliminary results of the efficacy analysis of cohort A and cohort B. If a Cohort C study is initiated, the Cohort C dosing regimen will be QL1706 7.5 mg\/kg q3w + bevacizumab safe dose q3w.

10. She is using her phone, 3+ hours per day with low contrast.
11. She always wear her glasses,she demads clear vision, even for her phone from a distance of 15cm.
12. She had eye examinations every 6 month, but her Opthalmologist would like to see Her every 3 month. As every time She was an exam, Her prescription always went higher, We fear that it will be with the 3 month period too, and Her myopia will skyrocket.

14. Is it certain, that her myopia will progress some extent?
15. Is it certain, that she will need some form of correction for her myopia the rest of her life without surgery? No myopia management, or refractive surgery, or ortho-k ever. As in fact, she already wear glasses, and demands to see clearly. If it is certain, you can say it, or what other options she have?

Lets make an example for an optometrist class, how can wrong prism prescription affect a patient.
1. Our theoretical patient is a 19 years old girl
2. She has glasses for both eyes of -1.25D
3. She is in school for 8 hours a day.
4. She is using computer for 4 hours a day from 1 meter distance
5. She using her phone with low contrast from 15-25cm distance at least 2 hours a day.
6. She prefer darker enviroment.
7. She has healthy eyes, no missalligment issues, or fatigue, except myopia.
8. She always wear her glasses, even for very close works.
9. This example is to show how small unnecessary base out diopter is need for the patient to develop some kind of esophoria.
question: Let assume, the optician who is making the new glasses mistakenly make it with 0.5 diopter base out prism for both eyes, without anyones knowledge. Is it enough to develop esophoria? Can the patient recognize the error, or just without glasses? Make an example please. What will be her eyes angle, after 2 years at her next exam, with the prisms instead of paralel, when looking infinity. Can the resulted misalignment deceive the examiner at the next exam, who will think it is natural, and leading to another error, or more prism? What is the possibility that the patient will show sign of some kind of esophoria at the next exam?
An 19 year old girl got new glasses with-1.25D. The new glasses have smaller pupillary distance by 6mm by hman mistake, so each eye has 0.375D base out prismatic effect. Without anyones knowledge. What could happen in the upcoming years? Possibilities in percent please. She always wear her glasses when awake. If adaptation occur, does it mean measurable misalignment, with or without glasses? Is it possible, that after 2 years the adaptation mislead the examiner at the next exam, because she will have discomfort without the prisms, or the examiner observe a slight misalignment, and she will prescribed with base out prisms because of this glasses?

You are Tina. You are here (An Kang Hospital) because you have been experiencing abdominal pain. You started feeling uncomfortable in your stomach three days ago.  You woke up in pain last night and couldn't sleep well. It was quite severe. If the most severe pain is rated at 10, you would say the pain you experienced at that time was around 4 to 5.  It has been persisting for the past three days. You got a fever started yesterday and lasted for one day. The fever when up to 39 degrees and then fluctuated, ups and downs. Also, sometimes you feel shivering. You have experienced a fever around three times since last night. You had fever or abdominal pain before, but never been that worst. 
You don’t feel like got to go pee. The colour of your urine has become very dark, like tea colour, but you don't experience any pain while urinating. You feel pain when you pee. You don’t possess an allergy-prone disposition. Your stool colour is lighter than usual and a bit whitish, no diarrhoea and constipation.
One night, you had a heavy meal, and the food wasn't unusual; about two hours later, you suddenly felt a stomachache. But the others who had the same meal didn't experience any issues. You feel like your stomach is dull and uncomfortable, not intensely painful, but it's difficult to describe the discomfort accurately. You have pain over upper abdomen, on the right upper area. It seems that the pain sometimes radiated to the back and also referred to the right shoulder. You have experienced stomach pain before, but it is different from now. This is the first time.
If a young individual who wear her glasses always, even for close work, age 19 is have -1.25D SE correction already, and is get unnecessary 1D base out prism  correction to both eyes to help distance vision by an opthamologist.Her next exam is scheduled 2 years from now. Can it cause esophoria in 2 years? Is 1 diopter base out prism for both eyes, can cause esophoria in long term? Does the individual can recognise  1D base out prism for both eyes? What will happen if the individual adapted to the correction over time, like 2 years, and her next exam try to be removed? What time is predicted to adapt to 1D base out prism  correction to both eyes, especially in a  young person?  Can it develop further myopia increase? If the 1D base out prism  correction to both eyes is a mistake, generaly how likely that esophoria is develop in 2 years, in a young person (Likely, quite likely, highly likely, very likely), if it possible in percent? I am fear, that my daughter prescribed with prisms unneseceraly. What does it mean, likely, quite likely, very likely, highly likely, certain, etc, particulary in her case, in percent?

Regarding the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, consumption of certain food substances may lead to tyramine toxicity mainly due to the following mechanism:
a. Cheese, red wine stimulates the release of stored tyramine causing tyramine toxicity
b. The hepatic and gastrointestinal monoamine oxidases metabolize these food substances to release
c. Cheese, red wine and processed meats can block the deamination of monoamines
d. Monoamines oxidase inhibitors can enhance the reversal of reuptake transporters
e. Cheese, red wine and processed meat can cause excess levels of circulating tyramine causing reversal of reuptake transporters

What should a patient do if a blood test reveals low BUN and lithium levels?
In theory we would like to show for educational purposes, how can affect a patient, when the optometrist is make a small error. Speculate what could be the minimum unnecessary base out prism for both eyes that can cause permanent esophoria, to a 19 year old girl with healthy eyes who always wear her -1.25D glasses? Please make an example. After 2 years with constant glasses wear, at the next exam the given prisms, how her eyes will angle instead of paralel, when looking for infinity can the result decieve the examiner, leading to another error? Could the patient recognize the error with constant glasses wear?

Doctor: OK, and when did you first start feeling breathless?
Patient: About two months ago.

Doctor: OK. And, do you feel, uh, how often do you feel breathless?
Patient: I'd say it's worse when I when I walk more than 50 meters. That's kind of the main like that's kind of the main trigger, just exertion.

###Input: Utility of troponin I in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. Baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities and market elevations not associated with myocardial necrosis make accurate diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) difficult in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. Troponin sampling may offer greater diagnostic utility in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes based on troponin positivity in patients with cocaine chest pain admitted for exclusion of MI. METHODS: Outcomes were examined in patients admitted for possible MI after cocaine use. All patients underwent a rapid rule-in protocol that included serial sampling of creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) over eight hours. Outcomes included CK-MB MI (CK-MB >or= 8 ng\/mL with a relative index [(CK-MB x 100)\/total CK] >or= 4, cardiac death, and significant coronary disease (>or=50%). RESULTS: Of the 246 admitted patients, 34 (14%) met CK-MB criteria for MI and 38 (16%) had cTnI elevations. Angiography was performed in 29 of 38 patients who were cTnI-positive, with significant disease present in 25 (86%). Three of the four patients without significant disease who had cTnI elevations met CK-M

Text:

The gut microbiota is closely related to good health; thus, there have been extensive efforts dedicated to improving health by controlling the gut microbial environment. Probiotics and prebiotics are being developed to support a healthier intestinal environment. However, much work remains to be performed to provide effective solutions to overcome individual differences in the gut microbial community. This study examined the importance of nutrients, other than dietary fiber, on the survival of gut bacteria in high-health-conscious populations. We found that vitamin B1, which is an essential nutrient for humans, had a significant effect on the survival and competition of bacteria in the symbiotic gut microbiota. In particular, sufficient dietary vitamin B1 intake affects the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae, and these bacteria have proven to require dietary vitamin B1 because they lack the de novo vitamin B1 synthetic pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that vitamin B1 is involved in the production of butyrate, along with the amount of acetate in the intestinal environment. We established the causality of possible associations and obtained mechanical insight, through in vivo murine experiments and in silico pathway analyses. These findings serve as a reference to support the development of methods to establish optimal intestinal environment conditions for healthy lifestyles.
Today the date is 19.02.2024 Please answer all questions with details especially regarding her vision without glasses, maybe she reconsider therapy by this. Point by point please.
If something is certain, say certain. 
1. Lets talk about an 19 years old european girl, Emese, who is my daughter, with no myopia in her family, who was born at 11.12.2004. She never had any problem with her sight before. 
2.Her myopia is discovered on a school vision screening, at 09.10.2021. on the first day, right after COVID restrictions, along more than half of her class, especially girls, who did not have glasses before. Who had glasses, had significantly higher progression than usual, or before. 
3. First presctription for myopia, after the COVID restrictions, at 11.10.2021 -0.5D SE, with axial length 25.0mm. 
4. Second presctription for myopia at 06.04.2022 -0.75D SE, axial length 25.3mm.
5. Her next prescription at 07.11.2022 -1.0D SE, axial length 25.7mm. This time the opthalmologist forwarded us to a myopia specialist.
6. Her latest prescription at 06.06.2023 -1.5D SE, axial length is 26.4mm (almost pathological, by the specialist).
7. She progressed from 0D to -1.5D in 20 months, wich is almost -1D per year.
8. She had eye examinations every 6 month, but her myopia specialist would like to see Her every 3 month. The myopia specialist is concerned that her axial length is progressed 1.4mm in 20 month.
8. What could be her prescription, for the next 2-3 years, and 5, and 10? realistic, worse, and catastrophic scenarios, and the likelyhood each scenario in percent please? 
9. What could be Her final prescription at a later year, in each scenario? 
10. What could be her speculated highest prescription for each scenario? 
11. She is in school 8 hours a day, and will be for the next 2,5 years. 
12. She is using computer, with high concentration demanding homework, and learning 4 hours a day. 
13. She is using her phone, 3+ hours per day with low contrast. 
14. She always wear her glasses,she demads clear vision, even for her phone from a distance of 15cm. 15. No myopia management, or refractive surgery, or ortho-k, she dont want to be experimented ever, She fear to risk worse outcomes. 
16. Unfortunately contact lenses was not tolerated by her eyesshe can use them only around 2 hours. 
17. Is it certain, that her myopia will progress some extent? 
18. Is it certain, that she will need glasses, (as other options excluded unfortunately), for her myopia the rest of her life without surgery, and living ever thickening glasses? No myopia management, or refractive surgery, or ortho-k ever. As in fact, she already wear glasses, and demands to see clearly. If it is certain, you can say it, or what other options she have?
19 At this point, please show as much possibilities, details and conseqencies, as You can, maybe She reconsider therapy. How far She would see without glasses, with the highest outcome? Will she be practically blind? What vision aids, devices can help her?

summarize: Pre‐eclampsia (PE) is a multisystem disorder that typically affects 2%–5% of pregnant women and is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, especially when the condition is of early onset. Globally, 76 000 women and 500 000 babies die each year from this disorder. Furthermore, women in low‐resource countries are at a higher risk of developing PE compared with those in high‐resource countries. Although a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of PE remains unclear, the current theory suggests a two‐stage process. The first stage is caused by shallow invasion of the trophoblast, resulting in inadequate remodeling of the spiral arteries. This is presumed to lead to the second stage, which involves the maternal response to endothelial dysfunction and imbalance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, resulting in the clinical features of the disorder. Accurate prediction and uniform prevention continue to elude us. The quest to effectively predict PE in the first trimester of pregnancy is fueled by the desire to identify women who are at high risk of developing PE, so that necessary measures can be initiated early enough to improve placentation and thus prevent or at least reduce the frequency of its occurrence. Furthermore, identification of an “at risk” group will allow tailored prenatal surveillance to anticipate and recognize the onset of the clinical syndrome and manage it promptly. PE has been previously defined as the onset of hypertension accompanied by significant proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Recently, the definition of PE has been broadened. Now the internationally agreed definition of PE is the one proposed by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP). According to the ISSHP, PE is defined as systolic blood pressure at ≥140 mm Hg and\/or diastolic blood pressure at ≥90 mm Hg on at least two occasions measured 4 hours apart in previously normotensive women and is accompanied by one or more of the following new‐onset conditions at or after 20 weeks of gestation: 1.Proteinuria (i.e. ≥30 mg\/mol protein:creatinine ratio; ≥300 mg\/24 hour; or ≥2 + dipstick); 2.Evidence of other maternal organ dysfunction, including: acute kidney injury (creatinine ≥90 μmol\/L; 1 mg\/dL); liver involvement (elevated transaminases, e.g. alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase >40 IU\/L) with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain; neurological complications (e.g. eclampsia, altered mental status, blindness, stroke, clonus, severe headaches, and persistent visual scotomata); or hematological complications (thrombocytopenia–platelet count <150 000\/μL, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis); or 3.Uteroplacental dysfunction (such as fetal growth restriction, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveform analysis, or stillbirth). It is well established that a number of maternal risk factors are associated with the development of PE: advanced maternal age; nulliparity; previous history of PE; short and long interpregnancy interval; use of assisted reproductive technologies; family history of PE; obesity; Afro‐Caribbean and South Asian racial origin; co‐morbid medical conditions including hyperglycemia in pregnancy; pre‐existing chronic hypertension; renal disease; and autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome. These risk factors have been described by various professional organizations for the identification of women at risk of PE; however, this approach to screening is inadequate for effective prediction of PE. PE can be subclassified into: 1.Early‐onset PE (with delivery at <34+0 weeks of gestation); 2.Preterm PE (with delivery at <37+0 weeks of gestation); 3.Late‐onset PE (with delivery at ≥34+0 weeks of gestation); 4.Term PE (with delivery at ≥37+0 weeks of gestation). These subclassifications are not mutually exclusive. Early‐onset PE is associated with a much higher risk of short‐ and long‐term maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Obstetricians managing women with preterm PE are faced with the challenge of balancing the need to achieve fetal maturation in utero with the risks to the mother and fetus of continuing the pregnancy longer. These risks include progression to eclampsia, development of placental abruption and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme, low platelet) syndrome. On the other hand, preterm delivery is associated with higher infant mortality rates and increased morbidity resulting from small for gestational age (SGA), thrombocytopenia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cerebral palsy, and an increased risk of various chronic diseases in adult life, particularly type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Women who have experienced PE may also face additional health problems in later life, as the condition is associated with an increased risk of death from future cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke, renal impairment, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. The life expectancy of women who developed preterm PE is reduced on average by 10 years. There is also significant impact on the infants in the long term, such as increased risks of insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension in infants born to pre‐eclamptic women. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) brought together international experts to discuss and evaluate current knowledge on PE and develop a document to frame the issues and suggest key actions to address the health burden posed by PE. FIGO's objectives, as outlined in this document, are: (1) To raise awareness of the links between PE and poor maternal and perinatal outcomes, as well as to the future health risks to mother and offspring, and demand a clearly defined global health agenda to tackle this issue; and (2) To create a consensus document that provides guidance for the first‐trimester screening and prevention of preterm PE, and to disseminate and encourage its use. Based on high‐quality evidence, the document outlines current global standards for the first‐trimester screening and prevention of preterm PE, which is in line with FIGO good clinical practice advice on first trimester screening and prevention of pre‐eclampsia in singleton pregnancy.1 It provides both the best and the most pragmatic recommendations according to the level of acceptability, feasibility, and ease of implementation that have the potential to produce the most significant impact in different resource settings. Suggestions are provided for a variety of different regional and resource settings based on their financial, human, and infrastructure resources, as well as for research priorities to bridge the current knowledge and evidence gap. To deal with the issue of PE, FIGO recommends the following: Public health focus: There should be greater international attention given to PE and to the links between maternal health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) on the Sustainable Developmental Goals agenda. Public health measures to increase awareness, access, affordability, and acceptance of preconception counselling, and prenatal and postnatal services for women of reproductive age should be prioritized. Greater efforts are required to raise awareness of the benefits of early prenatal visits targeted at reproductive‐aged women, particularly in low‐resource countries. Universal screening: All pregnant women should be screened for preterm PE during early pregnancy by the first‐trimester combined test with maternal risk factors and biomarkers as a one‐step procedure. The risk calculator is available free of charge at https:\/\/fetalmedicine.org\/research\/assess\/preeclampsia. FIGO encourages all countries and its member associations to adopt and promote strategies to ensure this. The best combined test is one that includes maternal risk factors, measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum placental growth factor (PLGF), and uterine artery pulsatility index (UTPI). Where it is not possible to measure PLGF and\/or UTPI, the baseline screening test should be a combination of maternal risk factors with MAP, and not maternal risk factors alone. If maternal serum pregnancy‐associated plasma protein A (PAPP‐A) is measured for routine first‐trimester screening for fetal aneuploidies, the result can be included for PE risk assessment. Variations to the full combined test would lead to a reduction in the performance screening. A woman is considered high risk when the risk is 1 in 100 or more based on the first‐trimester combined test with maternal risk factors, MAP, PLGF, and UTPI. Contingent screening: Where resources are limited, routine screening for preterm PE by maternal factors and MAP in all pregnancies and reserving measurements of PLGF and UTPI for a subgroup of the population (selected on the basis of the risk derived from screening by maternal factors and MAP) can be considered. Prophylactic measures: Following first‐trimester screening for preterm PE, women identified at high risk should receive aspirin prophylaxis commencing at 11–14+6 weeks of gestation at a dose of ~150 mg to be taken every night until 36 weeks of gestation, when delivery occurs, or when PE is diagnosed. Low‐dose aspirin should not be prescribed to all pregnant women. In women with low calcium intake (<800 mg\/d), either calcium replacement (≤1 g elemental calcium\/d) or calcium supplementation (1.5–2 g elemental calcium\/d) may reduce the burden of both early‐ and late‐onset PE.

Comparison between perfusion- and collateral-based triage for endovascular thrombectomy in a late time window.
Background and Purpose—
Perfusion-based triage has proven to be effective and safe for selecting patients who are likely to benefit from endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in a late time window. We investigated collateral-based triage for EVT in patients presenting beyond 6 hours, in terms of interrater reliability and efficacy in predicting clinical outcome, in comparison to perfusion-based triage.

Methods—
One hundred and thirty-two patients who underwent both computed tomographic angiography and computed tomography perfusion for anterior circulation large artery occlusion 6 to 24 hours after last seen well were enrolled. Patients were classified into EVT-eligible and EVT-ineligible groups according to perfusion- and collateral-based triages. We evaluated the interrater reliability of collateral-based triage and differences in good outcome rates of patients who received EVT in the EVT-eligible groups based on perfusion- and collateral-based triages.

Results—
Both computed tomographic angiography and computed tomography perfusion were assessable in 93 patients. Seventy-six patients were eligible for EVT according to perfusion-based triage. Among them, EVT was performed in 58, of whom 32 (55.1%) had good outcome. Sixty-nine patients were eligible for EVT based on collateral-based triage. Among them, EVT was performed in 50 patients, of whom 31 (62.0%) had good outcome. Interrater reliability of collateral-based triage was good (generalized κ=0.73 [95% CI, 0.59–0.84]). Agreement on EVT eligibility between perfusion- and collateral-based triages was moderate (κ=0.41 [95% CI, 0.16–0.61]). There was no difference in good outcome rates of patients who underwent EVT in the EVT-eligible groups based on perfusion- and collateral-based triages (55.1% versus 62.0%; P=0.0675).

Conclusions—
Collateral-based triage showed good interrater reliability and comparable efficacy to that of perfusion-based triage in predicting clinical outcome after EVT in patients presenting beyond 6 hours. Collateral-based triage is a reliable approach for selecting patients for EVT in the extended therapeutic time window.

1. Lets talk about an 19 years old european girl, Emese, who is my daughter, with no myopia in her family, who was born at 11.12.2004. She never had any problem with her sight before. Is it possible, that the enviromental factors of COVID restrictions caused the onset of her myopia in he late age of 16?
2. Her myopia is discovered on a school vision screening, on the first day, right after COVID restrictions, along more than half of her class, especially girls, who did not have glasses before. Who had glasses, had significantly higher progression than usual, or before.
3. First presctription for myopia, after the COVID restrictions, at 11.10.2021 -0.5D SE.

Are there any fallacies in the following argument? Be concise

Introduction:
Physical exercise is an essential aspect of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Regular exercise strengthens the bones and muscles, helping the body to accomplish day-to-day tasks. In addition, physical exercise has numerous benefits for mental health, including reducing stress and preventing depression. In this essay, I will argue that regular exercise is crucial for overall health and well-being.
Body:
Firstly, regular exercise can reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Exercise helps to maintain healthy blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar levels. By reducing the risk of these diseases, regular exercise can increase life expectancy and improve quality of life.
Secondly, regular exercise can improve mental health. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. This can help to reduce stress and anxiety, and prevent depression. In addition, regular exercise can improve cognitive function, including memory and attention span.
Thirdly, regular exercise can improve physical appearance. Exercise can help to maintain a healthy weight, tone muscles, and improve posture. This can lead to increased self-esteem and confidence.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, regular exercise is essential for overall health and well-being. It can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, improve mental health, and enhance physical appearance. By incorporating regular exercise into daily life, individuals can improve their quality of life and increase life expectancy.

Question: When was insulin first used to treat patients with diabetes?
Context: 1922: The first year of insulin therapy. First prescribers and first patients treated. Insulin was discovered in December 1921. One year later, several hundred diabetic patients were treated in Canada and the United States of America by this hormone changing the clinical spectrum of diabetes. The quick progress from impure pancreatic extracts to an active and safe insulin was obtained through a cooperation, under the aegis of the Insulin Committee of the Toronto University, between the clinicians of the General Hospital of Toronto (Canada), the Department of Physiology of the University of Toronto (Connaught Laboratories) and the US pharmacological industry (Eli-Lilly Company), who achieved a better purification of the extracts permitting large scale production. The story of the first beneficiaries and of the first prescribers illustrates the extraordinary progress this discovery permitted.
Answer 1: Insulin was first used to treat patients with diabetes in 1922.

文本：Purpose To report on the long-term results of a randomized trial comparing a standard dose (400 mg\/d) versus a higher dose (800 mg\/d) of imatinib in patients with metastatic or locally advanced GI stromal tumors (GISTs). Patients and Methods Eligible patients with advanced CD117-positive GIST from 56 institutions in 13 countries were randomly assigned to receive either imatinib 400 mg or 800 mg daily. Patients on the 400-mg arm were allowed to cross over to 800 mg upon progression. Results Between February 2001 and February 2002, 946 patients were accrued. Median age was 60 years (range, 18 to 91 years). Median follow-up time was 10.9 years. Median progression-free survival times were 1.7 and 2.0 years in the 400- and 800-mg arms, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.91; P = .18), and median overall survival time was 3.9 years in both treatment arms. The estimated 10-year progression-free survival rates were 9.5% and 9.2% for the 400- and 800-mg arms, respectively, and the estimated 10-year overall survival rates were 19.4% and 21.5%, respectively. At multivariable analysis, age (< 60 years), performance status (0 v ≥ 1), size of the largest lesion (smaller), and KIT mutation (exon 11) were significant prognostic factors for the probability of surviving beyond 10 years. Conclusion This trial was carried out on a worldwide intergroup basis, at the beginning of the learning curve of the use of imatinib, in a large population of patients with advanced GIST. With a long follow-up, 6% of patients are long-term progression free and 13% are survivors. Among clinical prognostic factors, only performance status, KIT mutation, and size of largest lesion predicted long-term outcome, likely pointing to a lower burden of disease. Genomic and\/or immune profiling could help understand long-term survivorship. Addressing secondary resistance remains a therapeutic challenge.

Question: When was insulin first used to treat patients with diabetes?
Context: 1922: The first year of insulin therapy. First prescribers and first patients treated. Insulin was discovered in December 1921. One year later, several hundred diabetic patients were treated in Canada and the United States of America by this hormone changing the clinical spectrum of diabetes. The quick progress from impure pancreatic extracts to an active and safe insulin was obtained through a cooperation, under the aegis of the Insulin Committee of the Toronto University, between the clinicians of the General Hospital of Toronto (Canada), the Department of Physiology of the University of Toronto (Connaught Laboratories) and the US pharmacological industry (Eli-Lilly Company), who achieved a better purification of the extracts permitting large scale production. The story of the first beneficiaries and of the first prescribers illustrates the extraordinary progress this discovery permitted.
Answer 1: Insulin was first used to treat patients with diabetes in 1922.
Answer 2: 1922

2. Her myopia is discovered on a school vision screening, on the first day, right after COVID restrictions, along more than half of her class, especially girls, who did not have glasses before. Who had glasses, had significantly higher progression than usual, or before.
3. First presctription for myopia, after the COVID restrictions, at 11.10.2021 -0.5D SE.
4. Second presctription for myopia at 06.04.2022 -0.75D SE.
5. Her next prescription at 07.11.2022 -1.0D SE.
6. Her latest prescription at 06.06.2023 -1.5D SE, progressed from 0D to -1.5D in 20 months.
7. What could be her prescription, for the next 2-3 years, and 5, and 10? Optimistic, realistic, worst scenarios please, and the likelyhood each scenario in percent please?
What could be Her final prescription at a later year, in each scenario?
8. She is in school 8 hours a day, and will be for the next 2,5 years.
9. She is using computer, with high concentration demanding homework, and learning 4 hours a day.
10. She is using her phone, 3+ hours per day with low contrast.
11. She always wear her glasses, even for her phone from a distance of 15cm.
12. She had eye examinations every 6 month, but her Opthalmologist would like to see Her every 3 month. As every time She was an exam, Her prescription always went higher, We fear that it will be with the 3 month period too, and Her myopia will skyrocket.
13. No myopia management, she is accepted that She is nearsighted, dont want to be experimented, and fear to risk worse outcomes.
14. Is it certain, that her myopia will progress some extent?
15. what does it mean, likely, quite likely, very likely, highly likely, certain, etc, and particulary in her case, in percent?
16. with example prescriptions please.

"You Have Been Lied to About Vitamin C
You may have heard the phrase “vitamins make expensive urine,” especially in reference to vitamin C. The idea behind it is that all the body needs is close to the RDA of vitamin C and that anything more is flushed down the toilet; mega-dosing vitamin C is simply a waste of money. This idea, if not completely contradicted by the available scientific research, is at the least a product of faulty reasoning.

Many animals make their own vitamin C daily in large amounts (~10 grams) and produce more during times of stress; as a result, they are much less likely to get sick and don’t get heart disease. Humans, primates, bats, and guinea pigs are exceptions and therefore must get their vitamin C through diet. It is only reasonable to question whether mega-doses of vitamin C could have a similar benefit for us as they do for animals.

Vitamin C is utilized in higher concentrations in specific areas of the body, such as the brain and the adrenal glands. For this reason, judging an individual’s need simply based on blood serum levels can be misleading. This may also be the case for some other vitamins such as B12. Obviously, this suggests that simply having a high enough serum level to avoid scurvy is unlikely to provide optimum health.

The amount or percent of a substance that is excreted doesn’t necessarily reflect its efficacy. Any nutrients or medications that are consumed are largely eliminated by the body, some more quickly than others depending on the half-life. The important thing is to attain a large enough concentration in the body in a short time. For example, if one drinks a cup of coffee in one hour, most of it will be absorbed into the blood and then some of that caffeine will block adenosine in the brain. But the rest that is left over in the blood will be eliminated by the urine. If one were to drink the same cup of coffee very slowly over 1 or 2 days, it would still mostly be absorbed into the blood, but would never reach a high enough concentration to have any meaningful effect. High urine levels of a substance are proof that it was absorbed into the blood, so singling out vitamin C as something that produces “expensive urine” is stupid.

On analyzing his own urine, Linus Pauling claimed an absorption rate of 85% when he was consuming 10 grams per day. According to this study, absorption drops to below 50% when doses exceed 1 gram per day. Absorption probably varies depending on the individual and how the vitamin C is taken. But clearly, a lower absorption rate at high doses is not a bad thing if what is absorbed is benefiting the body.

Finally, the purpose of high dose vitamin C is in its role as an antioxidant (electron donor) that neutralizes free radicals (molecules that have been oxidized, i.e., lost electrons). It may be that most health issues are at the root the result of oxidative stress but can be remedied by a sufficient supply of antioxidants. Vitamin C can donate 2 electrons and when it does, is reduced from ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). The amount or percent of vitamin C absorbed is irrelevant when it is being used in high doses to prevent or reverse oxidative stress. This study shows that DHA levels are increased in the urine after supplementing with vitamin C, as expected if electrons are being donated. Unless it can be shown that DHA levels do not change after supplementing, either in general or for a particular group of people, the argument that high dose vitamin C is without benefit does not hold water."

Is hearing aids would be benefical for a 19 year old schoolgirl, Emese, my daughter, who is sit in the last row in class? She is sporty, slim, has a cute face, and popular among her schoolmates. Of course she say, she dont have any problem with her hearing. She has around 15db loss both ears between 250-6000hz. We went to the audiologist due to a school screening. She is shy by the idea, she fear from the reactions of her friends and schoolmates, that after they see her with hearing aids, the first time in the Trial period, even if she wont need them in the future, from that moment, she always be the "deaf girl", and have to wear them all the time. We try to convince her as the audiologist think, she is borderline, but it is worth a trial. She was recommended a BTE hearing aids with multidirectional microphones and best quality audio, bluetooth, adaptive programs, AI, automatic gain, all tailored for her needs, and a thick full shell earmolds for noise cancelling. They will be obvious at the first sight, by her classmates. She hesitate to start the trial, she thinks that starting the trail is equal to wearing them forever from that moment, because her classmates will see them in first sight, and she will be the "deaf girl" from that moment. When she first try them on, and saw them, she started to cry. She said they are huge, and the shells make her look like deaf. Unfortunately theese BTE aids are much larger, and bulkier, than other types, but other types dont have all the features and special benefits,  for her needs. Trying something else under the trial period wont be an option, she need to experience the best possible. After the trial period, she can compare other models, and can experience the differencies stated by her audiologist. Of course she say that she dont have any problems with her hearing, but the screening, and the audiologist say the opposite. I fear that, if the aids are not necessary at the end, she still will be the "deaf girl" for her peers, and she never forgive me. Her biggest concern, that the aids are huge, bigger than her ears, and the shells make her looks like who is profoundly deaf. The first moment when she will try it in the school, she will be the "deaf girl" from the school to her schoolmates.

on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being best, rate the following: -- Analysis Also Found IPE Was Associated with a 41% Reduction in Total Events Compared with Placebo --

-- Subgroup Almost Exclusively Comprised of Patients with Established Cardiovascular Disease --

-- Findings Continue to Reinforce the Scientific Data and Clinical Use of VASCEPA®\/VAZKEPA® to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk --

-- Results Presented Today at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2023 and Simultaneously Published in the European Heart Journal Open --

DUBLIN, Ireland and BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Nov. 12, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amarin Corporation plc (NASDAQ:AMRN) today announced results from new REDUCE-IT analyses showing that among statin-treated patients in a prespecified subgroup with history of Metabolic Syndrome, but without diabetes at baseline, the addition of VASCEPA\/VAZKEPA (icosapent ethyl) significantly reduced the risk of first and total cardiovascular events. This subgroup was almost exclusively comprised of patients with established cardiovascular disease. The results were presented today at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2023, taking place November 11 – 13, 2023 in Philadelphia, PA and simultaneously published in the European Heart Journal Open.

More than 1 out of every 3 adult Americans have Metabolic Syndrome, a cluster of 3 or more of 5 risk factors: 1) waist circumference ≥40 inches [102 cm] in men and ≥35 inches [88 cm] in women, 2) blood pressure ≥130\/85 mmHg, 3) glucose ≥100 mg\/dL, 4) triglycerides ≥150 mg\/dL, and 5) HDL-C <40 mg\/dL in men and <50 mg\/dL in women.

Among patients with Metabolic Syndrome but without diabetes at baseline (n=2866), those who were allocated to icosapent ethyl (IPE) treatment with a median follow-up time of 4.9 years experienced a 29% relative risk reduction for the primary composite endpoint, defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina resulting in hospitalization (P <0.0001) (Absolute Risk Reduction [ARR]=5.9%; number needed to treat [NNT]=17) and a 41% reduction in total (first plus subsequent) events (P <0.0001) compared with placebo. The risk for the key secondary composite endpoint, defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke was reduced by 20% (P=0.05) and there was a 27% reduction in fatal\/nonfatal myocardial infarction (P=0.03), 47% reduction in urgent\/emergent revascularization (P <0.0001) and 58% reduction in hospitalization for unstable angina (P <0.0001). Non-statistically significant reductions were observed in cardiac arrest (44%) and sudden cardiac death (34%).

The large relative and absolute risk reductions observed supports IPE as an important therapeutic option for patients with metabolic syndrome at high cardiovascular risk, despite lacking robust effects on any metabolic syndrome component.

“These subgroup findings provide us with valuable insight into the role icosapent ethyl may play in helping reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with Metabolic Syndrome, but without concomitant diabetes, including those secondary prevention patients with established cardiovascular disease, a patient group particularly at high-risk of having another cardiovascular event,” said Michael Miller, M.D., cardiologist and Chief of Medicine, Corporal Michael J Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Professor of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “This is an area of growing concern for the medical community and for patients globally, given the steady rise in the number of patients with Metabolic Syndrome across the U.S. and around the world.”

Commenting on the findings, Amarin’s Chief Medical Officer Nabil Abadir said, “These data continue to reinforce the clinical value of IPE and expand the growing list of benefits attributable to the molecule, including secondary prevention patients such as those with prior myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary bypass grafting, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and history of cigarette smoking.”

Limitations of these analyses, some of which are exploratory in nature, include the relatively small number of events in certain subgroups or for certain endpoints, such as cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. In addition, variation in subjective measures (e.g., waist circumference) may have affected classification of metabolic syndrome.

In theory we would like to show for educational purposes, how can affect a patient, when the optometrist is make a small error.  Speculate what could be the minimum unnecessary base out prism for both eyes that can cause permanent esophoria, to a 19 year old girl with healthy eyes who always wear her -1.25D glasses? Please make an example. After adapted to the given prisms, how her eyes will angle instead of paralel, when looking for infinity?
An 18 year old girl, egó have normál vision, will be constantly overcorrected, and adjusted every 3 month to maintainit, by SPH -1D. What will be her prescription in the upcoming years, year by year? What kind of myopia will be occur?
## Patient Segment Extraction from Clinical Trial Information
**Introduction:**
This document is designed to guide the extraction of patient segment information from a specified clinical trial.

** Definitions of line of therapy for reference:**
**LOT1 (Initial Line of Therapy):**
**Definition:** LOT1, also known as the Initial Line of Therapy or the First Line of Therapy, is the first treatment approach offered to individuals diagnosed with a specific medical condition. It is typically recommended for all patients, whether they have received one prior therapy or have not undergone any previous treatment. In this stage, healthcare providers use the primary or standard treatment options based on the condition and the patient's overall health.

**LOT2 (Second Line of Therapy):**
**Definition:** LOT2, or the Second Line of Therapy, becomes relevant when individuals do not respond adequately or have adverse reactions to the initial treatment (LOT1). Inclusion criteria for LOT2 may include references to prior treatment failures, inadequate responses, incomplete responses, loss of response, or intolerance to specific therapies. Depending on the condition, LOT2 may involve the use of alternative medications or therapeutic approaches that are different from LOT1.

**LOT3 (Third Line of Therapy):**
**Definition:** LOT3, or the Third Line of Therapy, is considered when patients continue to experience treatment failures, inadequate responses, or intolerances after both LOT1 and LOT2 interventions. Inclusion criteria for LOT3 may explicitly reference prior failures or inadequate responses to prior therapies. At this stage, healthcare providers explore more advanced or specialized treatment options, such as biologic therapies, targeted therapies, or other advanced medical interventions, tailored to the specific medical condition.

**Not Applicable (NA):**
**Definition:** In cases where the trial does not mention a specific LOT or involves patients with no prior therapy mentioned in the inclusion criteria, the assigned LOT value will be 'NA' (Not Applicable). 'NA' indicates that there is no specific therapy mentioned in the trial, and it may apply to situations where prior treatments or treatment failures are not referenced.

**Neoadjuvant:**
**Definition:** Neoadjuvant therapy refers to treatments given before the primary therapy. Common in cancer care, it includes therapies like chemotherapy, radiation, or hormone therapy administered prior to the main treatment, usually surgery. Its goal is to reduce the size or extent of the cancer before the main treatment, making it potentially easier to remove or cure.

**Adjuvant:**
**Definition:** Adjuvant therapy is treatment given after the primary therapy to increase the chances of a cure. In cancer care, adjuvant therapy may include chemotherapy, radiation, or hormone therapy administered after surgery, with the aim to eliminate any remaining cancer cells, reduce the risk of cancer recurrence, and improve survival rates.

**Grouped Dictionary for Mapping Phrases to LOT Values:**
- Neoadjuvant: Pre-Surgery, Neo-adjuvant, Treatment Naive neo-adjuvant, Resectable, Surgical Resection Candidates, Treatment Window Period, 
- Adjuvant: Adjuvant Therapy, Post-Preoperative Treatment, Complete Resection, Postoperative Adjuvant Chemotherapy
- 1L : 1L Treatment, Chemotherapy-Naive, No Prior Advanced Disease Treatment, Post-Adjuvant Therapy, Treatment Naive, 1L Maintenance Therapy, Response to First-Line Treatment, Non-Progressors Post 1L, Alternative Treatment Options
- 2L : 2L Treatment, One Prior Regimen for Metastatic Disease, Platinum-Based Therapy Failure, Prior Standard Therapy Receipt, Post First-Line Progression, Treatment After Failure, Received 1 to 2 Prior Therapies, Recurrent\/Progressive Post Multimodal Therapy, 2L-Range Treatment
- 3L : 3L Treatment, Two Prior Regimens, Received At Least 2 Systemic Therapies, Disease Progression Post 2 Treatments, Failed 2 Prior Regimens, 3L-Range Treatment
- 4L: 4L Treatment, 4L-Range Treatment, Failed 3+ Prior Standard Therapies

**Instructions:**
1. Review the clinical trial information focusing on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
2. Extract key details relevant to the patient segment:
   - **Line of Therapy (LOT)**: Defined above.
   - **Disease Stage** : Refers to how much a disease, such as cancer, has progressed. It helps in assessing the severity, prognosis, and guiding treatment options. Factors like tumor size, spread, and lymph node involvement are considered, like metastatic, Advanced.
   - **Histology**: Microscopic study of tissue to identify cell types in diseases. In cancer, it distinguishes types like Squamous, Non-Squamous, or Adenocarcinoma, guiding diagnosis and treatment.
   - **Biomarkers**: A biological molecule, substance, or characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal physiological processes, pathological processes, or responses to therapeutic interventions, like KRASp.G12C mutation. 
3. Organize these details into a structured format for easy analysis.
4. Utilize the provided dictionary to map specific phrases found in the clinical trial information to their corresponding LOT values. Cross-reference any terms related to therapy or treatment with the dictionary to ensure accurate LOT classification.
5. If the model is not confident enough to provide a reliable or accurate output, please respond with 'Not Applicable'.
6. Cross-reference all extracted patient segment details with the provided definitions to ensure accurate and contextual understanding of each segment's characteristics.

**Output Format:**
For each disease studied in the trial, provide the patient segment information in the following format(No extra explanation, only below output as mentioned):
- Disease Name 1: \nLOT: ... \nStage: ... \nHistology: ... \nBiomarker: ...
- Disease Name 2: \nLOT: ... \nStage: ... \nHistology: ... \nBiomarker: ...
For example: 
   Disease Name: NSCLC \nLOT: 3L \nStage: Metastatic \nHistology: Not Applicable \nBiomarker: KRASp.G12C mutation

Given the review: Doctor is great, knowledgeable and balanced with common sense.  Staff was definitely poor quality. Lady at desk was nice but back office\\/nurse- terrible. They have an open area you can see and hear, and listening to them gossip about other patients and how gross they are while wearing disgustingly tight low neckline shirt is very unprofessional. Also, when they don't know how to use the basic equipment before the doctor comes in does not give much assurance. The doctor is kind enough and shows she knows what she is doing, but restaff.

1. Lets talk about an 19 years old european girl, Emese, who is my daughter, with no myopia in her family, who was born at 11.12.2004. She never had any problem with her sight before. Is it possible, that the enviromental factors of COVID restrictions caused the onset of her myopia in he late age of 16?
2. Her myopia is discovered on a school vision screening, on the first day, right after COVID restrictions, along more than half of her class, especially girls, who did not have glasses before. Who had glasses, had significantly higher progression than usual, or before.

5. Her next prescription at 07.11.2022 -1.0D SE.
6. Her latest prescription at 06.06.2023 -1.5D SE, progressed from 0D to -1.5D in 20 months.
7. What could be her prescription, for the next 2-3 years, and 5, and 10? Optimistic, realistic, worst scenarios please, and the likelyhood each scenario in percent please?

11. She always wear her glasses, even for her phone from a distance of 15cm.
12. She had eye examinations every 6 month, but her Opthalmologist would like to see Her every 3 month. As every time She was an exam, Her prescription always went higher, We fear that it will be with the 3 month period too, and Her myopia will skyrocket.
13. Is it certain, that her myopia will progress some extent?
14. what does it mean, likely, quite likely, very likely, highly likely, certain, etc, and particulary in her case, in percent?

How to slowly but surely increase muscle & body weight without looking fat?

In addition to limitations in movement, a decrease in visual ability is observed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. A possible reason for the worsening visual ability is the faster decrease of the retina (atrophy) in multiple sclerosis patients.  A randomized clinical trial should be planned to investigate if there is a higher retina atrophy (measured in µm\/year) in multiple sclerosis patients compared to healthy individuals. (Note: It is planned to measure retina atrophy only for one eye per patient = one measure per patient.) From a literature research the following information of the retina atrophy in multiple sclerosis patients and in healthy people resulted: Mean retina atrophy in healthy human is assumed to be -0.3 µm\/year and the standard deviation is assumed to be σ = 0.9 µm\/year. The standard deviation in retina atrophy in multiple sclerosis patients is assumed to be σ = 1.2 µm\/year.  Note that retina atrophy in negative as it measures a decrease: The smaller the faster the decrease.  
How many subjects in total are needed for this test to detect a difference in the retina atrophy of 1.8, i.e. mean retina decrease in multiple sclerosis patients that is by 1.8 µm\/year higher than in healthy individuals? The statistical test should have 80% power and be performed at a significance level of 5%. Determine the total sample size for the study and fully summarize your results in a final sentence.

Can you help me with something, please?
Something strange happened to me today, I started feeling unwell, then about 30 seconds later I started losing vision, everything turned to darkness few seconds later, and for another 30 seconds I was totally blind and felt unwell in the whole body, but still conscious, I managed to lay in bed, and then my vision started slowly recovering, total darkness was replaced with very bright and contrast yellow, and over next minute this yellow become less and less bright until it become normal, also I stopped feeling unwell during this time.

Do you have any idea what is it?
If a young individual age 19 is have -1.25D SE correction already, and is get unnecessary 1D base out prism correction to help distance vision by an opthamologist, can it cause esophoria? Is 1 diopter base out prism for both eyes, can cause esophoria in long term? Does the individual can recognise  1D base out prism? What will happen if the individual adapted to the correction over time? What time is predicted to adapt, hours, days, weeks, months especially in a  young peron? What is the possibility of esophoria develops by the unnecessary prisms especially in a young peron? Can it develop further myopia increase? If the prism correction is a mistake, is it certain that esophoria is develop, or what is the speculated, and estimated likelyhood in a young person, if it possible inpercent? I am fear, that my daughter prescribed with prisms unneseceraly.
What is the main purpose of each different phase of clinical trial? (Phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, etc.)
## Patient Segment Extraction from Clinical Trial Information
**Introduction:**
This document is designed to guide the extraction of patient segment information from a specified clinical trial.

** Definitions of line of therapy for reference:**
**LOT1 (Initial Line of Therapy):**
**Definition:** LOT1, also known as the Initial Line of Therapy or the First Line of Therapy, is the first treatment approach offered to individuals diagnosed with a specific medical condition. It is typically recommended for all patients, whether they have received one prior therapy or have not undergone any previous treatment. In this stage, healthcare providers use the primary or standard treatment options based on the condition and the patient's overall health.

**LOT2 (Second Line of Therapy):**
**Definition:** LOT2, or the Second Line of Therapy, becomes relevant when individuals do not respond adequately or have adverse reactions to the initial treatment (LOT1). Inclusion criteria for LOT2 may include references to prior treatment failures, inadequate responses, incomplete responses, loss of response, or intolerance to specific therapies. Depending on the condition, LOT2 may involve the use of alternative medications or therapeutic approaches that are different from LOT1.

**LOT3 (Third Line of Therapy):**
**Definition:** LOT3, or the Third Line of Therapy, is considered when patients continue to experience treatment failures, inadequate responses, or intolerances after both LOT1 and LOT2 interventions. Inclusion criteria for LOT3 may explicitly reference prior failures or inadequate responses to prior therapies. At this stage, healthcare providers explore more advanced or specialized treatment options, such as biologic therapies, targeted therapies, or other advanced medical interventions, tailored to the specific medical condition.

**Not Applicable (NA):**
**Definition:** In cases where the trial does not mention a specific LOT or involves patients with no prior therapy mentioned in the inclusion criteria, the assigned LOT value will be 'NA' (Not Applicable). 'NA' indicates that there is no specific therapy mentioned in the trial, and it may apply to situations where prior treatments or treatment failures are not referenced.

**Neoadjuvant:**
**Definition:** Neoadjuvant therapy refers to treatments given before the primary therapy. Common in cancer care, it includes therapies like chemotherapy, radiation, or hormone therapy administered prior to the main treatment, usually surgery. Its goal is to reduce the size or extent of the cancer before the main treatment, making it potentially easier to remove or cure.

**Adjuvant:**
**Definition:** Adjuvant therapy is treatment given after the primary therapy to increase the chances of a cure. In cancer care, adjuvant therapy may include chemotherapy, radiation, or hormone therapy administered after surgery, with the aim to eliminate any remaining cancer cells, reduce the risk of cancer recurrence, and improve survival rates.

**Grouped Dictionary for Mapping Phrases to LOT Values:**
- Neoadjuvant: Pre-Surgery, Neo-adjuvant, Treatment Naive neo-adjuvant, Resectable, Surgical Resection Candidates, Treatment Window Period, 
- Adjuvant: Adjuvant Therapy, Post-Preoperative Treatment, Complete Resection, Postoperative Adjuvant Chemotherapy
- 1L : 1L Treatment, Chemotherapy-Naive, No Prior Advanced Disease Treatment, Post-Adjuvant Therapy, Treatment Naive, 1L Maintenance Therapy, Response to First-Line Treatment, Non-Progressors Post 1L, Alternative Treatment Options
- 2L : 2L Treatment, One Prior Regimen for Metastatic Disease, Platinum-Based Therapy Failure, Prior Standard Therapy Receipt, Post First-Line Progression, Treatment After Failure, Received 1 to 2 Prior Therapies, Recurrent\/Progressive Post Multimodal Therapy, 2L-Range Treatment
- 3L : 3L Treatment, Two Prior Regimens, Received At Least 2 Systemic Therapies, Disease Progression Post 2 Treatments, Failed 2 Prior Regimens, 3L-Range Treatment
- 4L: 4L Treatment, 4L-Range Treatment, Failed 3+ Prior Standard Therapies

**Instructions:**
1. Review the clinical trial information focusing on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
2. Extract key details relevant to the patient segment:
   - **Line of Therapy (LOT)**: Defined above.
   - **Disease Stage** : Refers to how much a disease, such as cancer, has progressed. It helps in assessing the severity, prognosis, and guiding treatment options. Factors like tumor size, spread, and lymph node involvement are considered, like metastatic, Advanced.
   - **Histology**: Microscopic study of tissue to identify cell types in diseases. In cancer, it distinguishes types like Squamous, Non-Squamous, or Adenocarcinoma, guiding diagnosis and treatment.
   - **Biomarkers**: A biological molecule, substance, or characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal physiological processes, pathological processes, or responses to therapeutic interventions, like KRASp.G12C mutation. 
3. Organize these details into a structured format for easy analysis.
4. Utilize the provided dictionary to map specific phrases found in the clinical trial information to their corresponding LOT values. Cross-reference any terms related to therapy or treatment with the dictionary to ensure accurate LOT classification.
5. If the model is not confident enough to provide a reliable or accurate output, please respond with 'Not Applicable'.
6. Cross-reference all extracted patient segment details with the provided definitions to ensure accurate and contextual understanding of each segment's characteristics.

**Output Format:**

Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP);OR
A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.
Cohort 1 (MSS mCRC)

MSS is defined as 0-1 allelic shifts among 3-5 tumor microsatellite loci using a PCR-based assay or immunohistochemistry.
Must have received prior therapy with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.
Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1\/anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibody is not allowed.
Prior treatment with BRAF\/MEK inhibitor therapy (if BRAF mutated) and\/or EGFR targeted antibody (if KRAS WT) are allowed.
No more than 2 prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease.
Adjuvant therapy will count as 1 prior line of therapy if received within the prior 6 months; but if not does not count towards prior line of therapy.
PIV (pan-immune-inflammation) cutoff of 1200 obtained on labs obtained during Screening.
Cohort 2 (PD-1 R\/R melanoma)

PD-1 refractory disease as defined as progression on treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies. PD-1 treatment progression is defined by meeting all of the following criteria:

Receipt of at least 2 doses of an approved or investigational anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor.
Demonstrated PD after anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor as defined by RECIST v1.1. The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence of rapid clinical progression (as defined by the criteria in the sub-point below).
Progressive disease that has been documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor.
Progressive disease is determined according to iRECIST.
This determination is made by the investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial date of PD documentation will be considered the date of disease progression.
Subjects who progressed on\/within 3 months of adjuvant therapy with anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor will be allowed; an adjuvant therapy will count as 1 prior line of therapy if received within the prior 6 months.
Prior treatment with an anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody is allowed but not required.

Has received at least 2 doses of an approved or investigational anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor.
Has demonstrated PD after anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor as defined by RECIST v1.1. The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence of rapid clinical progression (as defined by the criteria in the sub-point below).
Progressive disease has been documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor.
Progressive disease is determined according to iRECIST.
This determination is made by the investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial date of PD documentation will be considered the date of disease progression.
Subjects who progressed on\/within 3 months of adjuvant therapy with anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor will be allowed; an adjuvant therapy will count as 1 prior line of therapy if received within the prior 6 months.
Prior treatment with an anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody is allowed but not required.
Prior treatment with BRAF\/MEK inhibitor therapy (if BRAF mutated) must have received and progressed or have demonstrable intolerance to approved targeted therapy.

Certainly, here's a detailed summary of our conversation up to this point:

John, a father, reached out for guidance regarding his 14-month-old son's developmental delays, specifically focusing on the MRI findings and potential diagnoses. Here are the key points discussed:

1. **Birth and Early Health History:**
   - John's son was born at 37 weeks with a low 1-minute APGAR score that improved by 5 minutes.
   - He was diagnosed with axial hypotonia (muscle tone issues in the trunk), had torticollis, and laryngomalacia (resolved).
   - Early developmental milestones were discussed, including speech, rolling over, sitting, crawling, and standing.

2. **MRI Findings:**
   - The MRI revealed abnormal T2 hyperintensities in the deep bilateral frontoparietal periventricular white matter.
   - Other minor abnormalities were noted, but no specific cause was identified.
   - The MRI findings were suggested as a potential cause for his motor tone issues.

3. **Neurology Consultations:**
   - John had a neurology consultation, but it didn't provide conclusive information.
   - He expressed the need for insights independent of specialists and mentioned an upcoming consultation with a different neurologist.

4. **Medical Tests:**
   - Various medical tests, including genetic testing, metabolic panels, and lactic acid levels, were performed, with most results coming back normal.

5. **Assessment and Probabilities:**
   - We assessed the likelihood of Global Developmental Delay (GDD) and gross motor delay based on developmental milestones and PDMS-2 assessment scores.
   - Moderate probability of gross motor delay and low to moderate probability of GDD were discussed.

6. **Developmental Milestones:**
   - 15-month developmental milestones related to the affected brain areas were explored, considering motor skills, language, cognition, sensory processing, and spatial awareness.

7. **Further Questions:**
   - John requested more information about developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and its prognosis.
   - He inquired about the percentage of children with DCD who graduate college.
   - John also asked about the presentation of dyspraxia in a 14-month-old and requested a ranking of common symptoms.

8. **Detailed Description of Motor Delay:**
   - John provided additional information about his son's abilities, including object manipulation, responses to names and commands, play behaviors, and physical conditions.

9. **Cruising and Vertical Surfaces:**
   - John discussed his son's challenges with cruising on vertical surfaces and inquired about improving this skill.

10. **Axial Hypotonia and Autism:**
    - John asked about the connection between axial hypotonia and autism and whether his son might be at risk for autism.

11. **Third PDMS-2 Assessment:**
    - John shared the results of his son's third PDMS-2 assessment, including standard scores for different domains.

12. **Summary for Continuing the Conversation:**
    - John requested a summary of our conversation to share with someone else who would continue the discussion.

Overall, John seeks a better understanding of his son's condition, potential diagnoses, and strategies to support his development. He values thorough information and guidance.

find the case type using this instructions -----     ******* Medical Case Classification Instructions *********
                                Analyze: presenting history.

                                Clarity on Normal Cases:
                                - Presenting Difficulties: Scrutinize the presenting history, encompassing the patient's challenges, complaints, symptoms, or medical difficulties.
                                - Underwent Further Medical Management: Examine cases where the patient is admitted for further management, indicating medical intervention beyond the presenting difficulties.
                                - Procedures: Explicitly assess if the case mentions admission specifically for a medical procedure or surgery.

                                Accurate Case Classification Guidelines:
                                - Normal Case: Admitted with difficulties, managed medically. Procedures alone do not categorize as a "Procedure Case." Ensure the presenting history includes challenges, complaints, or medical difficulties. Look for phrases like "presented with complaints."
                                - Procedure Case: Look for the absence of presenting history or phrases like "known case of." Patients explicitly admitted for procedures or surgery fall into this category.
                                - Self-Harm Case: Thoroughly consider cases where the patient intentionally harmed themselves (e.g., hanging, drugs, chemicals, burning, falling).
                                - Assault Case: Examine instances where the patient is admitted due to assault or an attempted assault.

I want to recover from common cold faster. The main problems are:

1. Sore throat. The pain usually went away within a couple of days when I was younger (and I got sick less often), but now it persists for 5-7 days.
2. Dry cough. It may persist for a month or two, gradually decreasing. This is really annoying, because this becomes my excuse for not working out. Basically I've got less fit for the last, u-m, five years. This is like feedback loop. COVID and lockdown made notable contribution.

Is it possible, that the enviromental factors of COVID restrictions caused the onset of her myopia in he late age of 16?

What time is predicted to adapt to 1D base out prism  correction to both eyes, especially in a  young person?  Can it develop further myopia increase? If the 1D base out prism  correction to both eyes is a mistake, is it certain that esophoria is develop in 2 years, or what is the likelyhood in a young person (Likely, quite likely, highly likely, very likely), if it possible inpercent? I am fear, that my daughter prescribed with prisms unneseceraly. What does it mean, likely, quite likely, very likely, highly likely, certain, etc, particulary in her case, in percent?

Read this clinical vignette and make a list of 5 differential diagnoses, explaining your reaosning:
A 57 year old man developed painful, progressive limb weakness. Within 10 months, he required a wheelchair. His CSF showed a protein of 114 mg\/aL, no cells. He was diagnosed with CIDP. He was started on both IVig and plasma exchange, with no benefit from either.
An EMG revealed demyelinating range slowing, prolonged distal latencies, and lots of axonal loss.
His CBC was remarkable only for elevated platelets. An SPEP was normal.
At this point, a physical exam was repeated and showed moderate diffuse weakness and muscle atrophy, absent muscle stretch reflexes, diffuse pitting edema, lymphadenopathy, thick body hair, hepatosplenomegaly, and papilledema.

Please generate one very long fake post posted on a bulletin board sight focused on parents discussing their struggles with overweight kids and teens and their weight loss. The post should be from a somewhat depressed mother of an overweight teenaged girl, 13 to 15, who slowly have been gaining more weight despite her and her mom's best efforts. The mom's are all shocked and angry at their daughter's and are venting online. The post should be 500-750 words, and start with an information header containing current date, the Parent's name, and the daughter's age, daughter's current weight, and daughter's current height both in US units. Please make sure you vary the emotional content and situations and the amount gained per the parent's situation. The post should detail carefully in all the nice and not so nice detail how they got into this situation over the past years or life. It should detail specific situations, people by name, and any other info to make this a realistic venting of how the mother's daughter got overweight. Include specific weight measurements from each period of the story and a full tracking of fluctuations in the past, at each age or so the mother should mension her daughter's weight at the time and "a few" pounds up or down or the like should be expressed with actual numbers. Remember, you're simulating  a parent with their own specific struggles, characteristics, and children.

You are an underwriter with medical knowledge. Your task is extract the its causal chain of death from the text and categorize it into one of the following labels with its specific cause according to principle of proximate cause: 
'''
A. Declaration of death
B. Suicide
C. Otherwise killed
D. Non-traffic accidents
E. Traffic accidents
F. not possible to determine the type of accident that led to the death
G. Tumors
H. Diseases of the circulatory and blood system
I. Diseases of Respiratory system
J. Diseases of the digestive system
K. Diseases of the urinary and reproductive system
L. Neurological and motor disorders
M. Diseases of Endocrine\/immune\/metabolic
N. diseases that cannot be classified as specific systems
O. not possible to determine the type of disease that led to the death, like sudden death
''' 
There are two type of causal chain of death: [a. chain of causation b. interrupted causation].
Some examples with their output answers are provided below:
Example: Insured slipped and fell unconscious in the bathroom and died of a cerebral hemorrhage on the way to the hospital for treatment
Output: Cause of death: D; Cause of death chain: [[D,H]]; Chain type: a 

Example: Insured slipped and fell unconscious in the bathroom and died in an automobile accident while being transported to the hospital for treatment
Output: Cause of death: E; Cause of death chain: [[D],[E]]; Chain type: b 

You can find that the chain is consisted of multi list when the causal types of the chain of death is "b" and one list when "a". 

Now I want you to label the following example:
Input: Car accident, then died in the hospital during resuscitation due to a doctor's error that led to an unsuccessful surgery
Output:

1. 19 year old Emese who is thin (165cm 48kg.), have sudden shooting pain under, and below her kneecap, when straighten her leg fully, or climbing a bit more stairs will result constant pain, easily overuse her right knee.
2. Orthopedic doctor made x-ray, but  an ultrasonic exam will be only after one month.
3. The doctor suggested to use a Patellar Tendon Strap, what she didnt feel supportive at all, so straps out of question.
4. Emese feels better a simple elastic Compression Sleeve.
5. Can a simple elastic Compression Sleeve provide that kind of specified support what she need?
6. What would be the best brace to her until the exam, regarding avoid any possible further complication, wich is crucial?
7. What type of brace would be the best until the exam, considering, that she is in school, and other daily activities, suggestion with percent?
8. Can you name some braces what could be the best, suggestion in percent?
9. What brace you suggest more than others?
10. Please name what brace would be the safest choice regarding to prevent further comlpications?
