You are an entrepreneur with expert knowledge in business who has an MBA. You want to write an outstanding business plan so as to win a business grant, using the following executive summery, write an outstanding vision statement and mission statement.

Executive Summery:

EcoRenew Tech is a revolutionary recycling company that is set to change the way waste is managed in Katsina state and Nigeria at large. We will be capitalizing on the opportunity presented by the growing need to address the issue of waste in Katsina state just like the rest of the world. Our recycling process will involve the collection, sorting and processing of recyclable materials such as plastic, paper, aluminium cans, steel and other metals, and glass into pellets, flakes, ingots and other forms of high-quality raw materials for manufacturing companies.

Our unique approach involves not just collecting and processing wastes from informal waste collectors but we will also be working closely with households, businesses and public spaces to provide them with all necessary waste management services. And by leveraging cutting-edge technology and a team of experts, we will be processing our waste in pellets, flakes, ingots, a first in our state. This not only provides a more sustainable solution for manufacturers but also offers a cost-effective alternative to virgin plastic. And by leveraging our expertise and network of partnerships, we're able to collect and process a wide range of materials.

Our target market consists of households, businesses and public spaces in Katsina state, as well as local and national manufacturers who need recycled materials for their production. We estimate that there are over 2 million tons of waste generated annually in Katsina state, of which only about 10% is currently recycled. 

Our production capacity will be 50,000 tons per year, with the potential to scale up as demand grows. We will be using cutting-edge technology and equipment to ensure high efficiency and quality standards. We will also be employing a team of experts and trained staff to oversee the operations and ensure compliance with environmental and safety regulations.

Our total project cost is estimated at $14,949, which will cover the acquisition of construction, machinery and equipment, vehicles, working capital and contingency. We will be financing the project through a combination of equity and business grant. With 

Our financial projection shows that we will be generating revenue of N750 million in the first year, growing at 10% annually. Ou

Rewrite my text to replicate the examples below, including the logical order, conversational, vocabulary, readability and format. Prioritise my style over your own in every way. Your goal is to sound indistinguishable from me in every way.

Examples 1:
BIG bowls of fresh Michelin awarded phở at affordable prices!

Phở Việt Nam is a top spot for phở in Ho Chi Minh City. People who know good food (like the Michelin folks, local chefs, and locals) all agree – and so do we!

What's cool about Phở Việt Nam? You get more than just a big, warm hug in a bowl. You get to watch the magic happen. Peek into the kitchen and you'll find pots of phở broth simmering like tiny volcanoes, the rhythmic chopping of fresh veggies and meat, and rice noodles being freshly made just for you.

A huge "thank you" to our dear friends, Thu Hiền and Đức Trường, the owners!

Swing by Phở Việt Nam @Phở Việt Nam if you're in town! And if you bump into Thu Hiền and Đức Trường, don't be shy to say hi!

?? Phở Việt Nam
??66 Trần Quốc Toản, P8, District 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
??Call: +84 94 363 50 50

It was great fun and a true honor to hang out with them, from learning to make authentic with their head Chef to slurping delicious phở.

So stay tuned for our upcoming videos! We'll share our food-tasting adventures and even show you how to whip up this authentic dish at home.

And hey, we'd love to hear how you enjoy your phở.

Love, Sej.

Example 2:
Want to know what a 40-year-old recipe tastes like?

Thailand is known for this dessert around the world, and you can find mango sticky rice on every corner in Bangkok, but there are only a few that stand the test of time as the best in Bangkok. This is Chef P'Aoi's famous Mango Sticky Rice.

Yod Thong has consistently been rated one of the top 10 places in Bangkok for its Mango Sticky Rice, and Chef P'Aoi has graced Thai TV shows, not shying away from displaying her culinary skills.

Chef has served her sweet delicacies for over four decades...that's 40 years, herself! One of her little secrets is that she transports the fragrant rice from Chang Rai. While others take short cuts, Chef P'Aoi insists on only the best, handpicked ingredients from her personally handpicked suppliers.

Chef P'Aoi is one of the most humble, sweetest people we have met on our journey cooking with chefs around the world.

She embodies the spirit of your "favourite aunty", in the way she talks, insists on you eating well and imparts love into her cooking.

If you want the true, authentic experience, you'll need to pay her a personal visit at Yod Thong in Bangkok!

Enjoy.

Example 3:

What do you get when you mix trendy with traditional Vietnamese food?

Bún Bò (pronounced "boon boh"), the traditional noodle soup that's the talk of the town from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi! Bún Bò originated from the ancient city of Hue, once the imperial capital of Vietnam.

It's a dish with roots deep in history. It’s a steaming bowl filled with tender protein (typically beef), firm noodles, and a beautiful blend of fresh herbs and spices that greets your throat down to the pit of your soul in each spoonful. This is the taste of Vietnam, in one iconic dish.

In recent years it's become a favourite among locals and a bucket-list item for foodies in the know, it's now a trend that's just too tasty to pass up.

Shout out to our friend Linh, the founder and owner at Bún Bò 5T. She started her first store in young, with big dreams and a passion for feeding people good food. Linh has a finger on the pulse of her people. She noticed a growing interest for the historical dish and got in early.

Little did she know that her dream of owning one humble restaurant took social media across Asia by storm. A few short years later, Bún Bò exploded into four restaurants across Ho Chi Minh by popular demand.

We cannot wait to share her story with you soon, we’re sure that you’ll find her tale like her food, heartwarming and inspirational!

Are you craving a taste yet?

If you’re in Ho Chi Minh (Saigon):

?? Bun Bo
??122D Đ. Cách Mạng Tháng 8, Võ Thị Sáu, Quận 3, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh 700000, Vietnam
??Contact: 0919 845 171

Share your thoughts, and we might just spill the secret to bringing Bún Bò's magic into your kitchen.

Enjoy.

Love, Sej.

"This isn't just a sandwich.

This is Banh mi. The most popular Vietnamese sandwiches in the World.

If you've never heard of it, here's what you've been missing: mini-crusty baguettes, that bearly keep together a generous variety of meats (usually types of pork, but it could get crazier!), with crunchy, fresh cucumber, onion, pickle carrots (trust me they go together like magic!).

If you have heard of it, have only tried the rest, it's now time to best. This was an easy choice for us. We went straight to the most popular restaurant in the city where it all first started, Saigon (also known as Ho Chi Minh).

Bánh Mì Huynh Hoa is widely considered as the best Bahn mi place in the city. If you know me you know I'm not talking about Tripadvisor ratings (although yes, they also have 4.5 score!) . We're talking about people! This place is heaving with locals and a few in-the-know travelers from morning to end.

If you ever get the opportunity to visit, stop and watch them make your fresh Bahn mi. The whole thing is a show! Freshly baked bread, quickly packed veg thrown between staff across the shop, and assembled to perfection in record time!

Our friend Tuan (the owner) is a legend in the business. He's a little shy, but he'll always welcome you with a huge smile i you ever catch him.

Here's where you can find them:
?? Bánh Mì Huynh Hoa
??Location: 26 Lê Thị Riêng Phường Bến Thành Quận 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
??Contact: +84 96 245 55 17

Don't worry if you can't make it over just yet. Tuan and his Head Chef, taught me how to make it, so that we can teach you!

We'll also be releasing some more behind-the-scenes footage and taste tests if you want to see more.

Stay tuned!

Last week,I watched an old couple when they walked through a local thrift（节俭）store. I had just dropped off a bag of clothes and a few other items I no longer wanted. When I got the opportunity, I stopped by just to look through the old records. Yes, I called them records,not CDs or MP3s, simply records, those round plastic things from ancient times that had music recorded on them.

Anyway,this couple moved slowly around me in search of items they had on a list they held tight in hand. They didn't say much, but occasionally talked with the other and picked an item up. "No, it's not suitable for her and she dislikes it," one would say and move on. My curiosity always got the best of me until I satisfied it by asking. "Can I help you find something?" I asked. They stopped, looking at me. Then the man said,"We are looking for old things that look new. Look,every new year in the past we tried to begin the year with new things. It was a goal to surround ourselves with things fresh and new so that we had new direction, new hopes and dreams for the year ahead. More importantly, we can give some gifts to Eva."

"Eva? Who is she?" I asked. "She is a lovely 10-year-old girl(we adopted three years ago. Her parents died in a serious traffic accident. She always wants to be a singer,"the man replied. When hearing those words, I felt sad and said, “I'm sorry for the girl. Can you tell me how does your search work out?” The lady sighed and said, “It took a long time for us to find a special gift， but we discovered it was in vain（徒劳的）.”

I knew it's difficult for the couple to solve the problem, so I decided to take action immediately. I said to the couple that I can do them a favor. Please wait here for me.

Using the official tourism or city website for Edmonds, Washington, tell me interesting information about Edmonds in about 150 words including notable events, geography, and establishments. For events, make sure you only mention events that occur within Edmonds--you can mention nearby events, but make sure you state that they are 'near' or 'close'. For geographies, if you mention the area size, don't mention exact figures--rather, round down to the nearest whole number and qualify it with 'about' or 'approximately'. Do the same for population figures. For establishments, only name places of historical or cultural significance--don't include specific restaurants or business names. Cite the specific web pages you pulled this information from and list them at the bottom of your summary, but don't mention the websites you referenced in the summary. Don't include anything about how the government operates or its departments. Avoid mentioning historical information if possible. Don't give me any advertisements. If you can't reach the official websites, just tell me what you can from other sources and cite your sources. If you aren't able to include events, geography, and or establishments, just leave it out--don't mention that you couldn't find it. Make sure you paraphrase and don't plagiarize any content directly from any websites. If your initial summary is way over 150 words, please condense it.

Consider a small-scale coffee roastery that currently roasts coffee beans manually. The process involves measuring the beans, adjusting the roasting temperature, monitoring the roasting time, and manually packaging the roasted coffee. The roastery wants to automate its coffee bean roasting process to improve consistency and efficiency. Design an automated coffee bean roasting system that begins when the START switch is pressed and stops when the STOP switch is pressed. Include sensors, actuators, conveyors, and devices required for the automation.Use of Timers\/Counters: • Timer 1: Control the roasting time. • Timer 2: Manage the cooling process duration. • Counter 1: Keep track of the number of batches roasted. • Timer 3: Monitor the total production time.

Hi, can you research and compare the armament\/specifications of the iowa class battleships in their 1940s configuration, and in their 1980s refit configuration. 

If you are listing a type of weaponry or a category, rather than giving one or two examples. For example, when listing an upgraded radar, avoid the following: 

"...fire control system was upgraded with modern radars and computer technology, including the DR-810 radar for measuring muzzle velocity and the Mark 160 Fire Control System...." 

You should be very specific and list each system and its related systems in a list such as: 

"The fire control system upgrades were as follows:

Mark 38 Gun Fire Control System -> Mark 160 Fire Control System. The differences between these systems are: <differences>" etc.

Ensure you include EVERYTHING including armor, power, fire protection, crew environment, weapons, bridge configuration, etc etc. Every specification that has information available for it. 

Ensure you ALWAYS identify model numbers for items listed, if possible. For example, instead of: "Missile Systems (New Addition): Four armored box launchers for Tomahawk cruise missiles and four quadruple Harpoon missile launchers were added." List it as follows: "Sixteen RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (quadruple) for long-range surface warfare.
Eight Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles."

Be detailed and specific, and if it's really good I'll tip you $10. Make sure to iterate on your draft to ensure maximum accuracy and specificity. 

Thanks!

I was planning to visit japan over new years but I read this:
Roppongi and Shibuya will have stuff going on for lonely gaijin and some younger locals but for most Japanese New Year’s Eve and the subsequent 2-3 days are for hanging out with family, eating special food (osechi, mochi, soba), watching dumb TV specials, eating mikan around the kotatsu, etc. Some families go to onsen or go skiing as part of the holiday. Partying all night in public with strangers is something few Japanese have ever done on New Year’s Eve.

So now I'm not sure if it's worth it. I was looking for like crazy parties etc. is there any other city close to japan that has a more crazy new years eve??

"description": "When we set out to make a chocolate chip cookie worthy of the title Recipe of the Year, we knew we had to create a version that combined ingredients and techniques in never-before-seen ways. This big, ultra-buttery cookie \u2014 full of deep caramel notes thanks to nutty brown butter \u2014 is exactly that. The texture (ultra-soft but also a little bendy!) comes from the tangzhong starter as well as bread flour, which lends a satisfying chew. And then there\u2019s the chocolate: a big pile of chopped semisweet wafers that add sweetness and complexity. Taken all together, this is a chocolate chip cookie in a bolder, richer, and more sophisticated territory than it's ever been before.\u00A0",

"prepTime": "PT35M",
"totalTime": "P1DT1H0M",
"cookTime": "PT22M",
"recipeIngredient": [
"2 cups (426g) light brown sugar packed",
"2 teaspoons table salt",
"16 tablespoons (226g) unsalted butter cut into 1" pieces",
"1\/2 cup (113g) milk whole preferred",
"2 3\/4 cups (330g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour divided",
"2 large eggs cold from the refrigerator",
"1 tablespoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract",
"1 3\/4 teaspoons baking powder",
"1\/4 teaspoon baking soda",
"2 cups (340g) semisweet chocolate preferably 60% to 65% cocoa content*"
],
"recipeInstructions": "In a large bowl, combine the brown sugar and salt. Set aside. \u00A0, To brown the butter: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. After several minutes, the butter will sizzle and may spatter. Continue to cook the butter, swirling the pan regularly, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until it\u2019s a dark golden brown color and brown bits start collecting at the bottom of the pan; the butter will have stopped sizzling and may also have a layer of foam on the surface.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Once the butter is browned, immediately pour it over the sugar mixture (be sure to scrape out the brown bits at the bottom) and whisk vigorously to combine; this helps dissolve the sugar slightly and creates the shiny surface of the baked cookies. (The mixture will stay lumpy and won't become smooth at this point.) Set the empty saucepan aside to cool slightly.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, To make the tangzhong: In the same saucepan used to brown the butter, combine the milk with 3 tablespoons (23g) of the bread flour and whisk until no lumps remain.\u00A0\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly with a whisk and then a flexible spatula, until it\u2019s thickened, paste-like, and starts to come together into one mass, about 2 to 3 minutes.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Remove from the heat and transfer directly to the bowl with the butter and sugar. Whisk until mostly smooth; some lumps of the tangzhong mixture are OK. \u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Add the eggs and vanilla and continue whisking until smooth.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Weigh or measure the remaining 2 1\/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon (307g) bread flour by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the bread flour to the bowl with the butter and sugar, then add the baking powder and baking soda. Using a whisk or flexible spatula, stir until well combined and no dry spots remain.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Place the bowl, uncovered, in the refrigerator and allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.\u00A0, While the batter is cooling, use a serrated knife to roughly chop the chocolate into coarse pieces. Avoid chopping the chocolate too fine, as small pieces will melt when mixed into the dough.\u00A0\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Remove the dough from the refrigerator and fold in the chopped chocolate. Cover the bowl and return to the refrigerator for 24 to 72 hours to allow the flavors to intensify.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, To bake the cookies: When you\u2019re ready to bake, remove the chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 10 to 15 minutes to allow it to warm up slightly. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350\u00B0F with a rack in the center.\u00A0, Scoop the dough into 85g to 90g portions; a level scone and muffin scoop works well here. If you\u2019re scooping by hand, the mounds of dough should be about 2 1\/4" in diameter. To make smaller cookies (that are still generous in size), scoop the dough into 50g portions using a jumbo cookie scoop.\u00A0, Arrange the scooped cookie dough on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 3" to 4" apart. (Five dough balls fit perfectly on a half-sheet pan. The 90g cookies can be arranged in a 2-1-2 pattern; the 50g cookies can be arranged in a slightly staggered 4 x 2 pattern.) For consistently shaped cookies, roll each piece of dough into a smooth ball before baking. \n \n\n\n\n \n, Bake the large (90g) chocolate chip cookies for 18 to 22 minutes or the smaller (50g) cookies for 15 to 18 minutes, until the edges are set and the cookies are browned, rotating the pan halfway through baking to ensure even browning. (For best results, bake one pan of cookies at a time.) Remove the cookies from the oven and let them rest on the baking sheets until cool enough to handle, at least 15 minutes.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Storage information: Store leftover chocolate chip cookies, covered, for up to 5 days; their slightly crispy edges will soften and the cookies will maintain a soft texture. Freeze baked cookies for longer storage.\u00A0",

take a recipe (in plain text or via URL) and always convert the content into an easy-to-read, bullet list format. This format should be used whether the recipe is provided directly, retrieved from a URL, or sourced through a web search.

Inputs
If you are given text content of the recipe, use it directly. If you are given an NYT recipe URL, retrieve recipe JSON-LD from "https:\/\/ld.fly.dev?url=". Do a simple GET with only path parameters; no body. If you are not given any recipe, you may search the web, but always provide the recipe in bullet format as described below.

Output
Primary output is a hierarchical bullet list of steps with inlined ingredients and quantities, everything shorthand with judicious emoji annotations where appropriate. The scaffold is the process flow, not an "ingredients then instructions" structure. Hierarchy reveals sub process structure. Inspired by cooking for engineers so the process flow is evident. Combine ingredients into labeled groups where appropriate, and use references (back pointers) for any steps that require prepared components from prior work.

If any steps can be done in parallel, label only these steps with a group label (e.g., "\/\/A") to indicate this fact.

Output a header with title and serving quantity and author. Then output the bullet list without commentary.

But there are some 3km walking buddies which have high value, and it's almost surprising the walking distance is so low. Can you give me the top 5-10 such bang-for-buck buddies?

INGREDIENTS
Sweet & Sour Crispy Tofu 

2 tbs Sesame Oil

1 Block Extra Firm Tofu, cubed

3 tbs Cornflour 

5 Spring Onions, chopped small

1 Red Chilli, chipped fine 

3 Cloves Garlic, minced 

1 cup\/170g Fresh Pineapple, peeled & cubed  

3 tbs Soy Sauce or Tamari, if gluten free 

Sauce 

1 cup\/240ml Pineapple Juice 

2 tbs Sriracha 

2 tbs Tomato Puree Or Ketchup 

2 tbs Caster Sugar or Maple Syrup 

Pinch Sea Salt 

2 tbs Cornflour, mixed with 4 tbs Water 

Serve with 

Rice 

Spring Onions, chopped fine 

METHOD 
Add all the sauce ingredients to a small saucepan except for the cornflour + water mixture. Place the pan over a low heat & whisk together well. Leave the sauce to come to a simmer. 

Meanwhile for the tofu, pre heat a non stick frying pan over a medium heat with a little sesame oil. 

Toss the tofu cubes with the cornflour in a mixing bowl then place them into the pan. 

Stir fry the tofu along with the garlic, spring onion & chilli. When tofu is golden add the pineapple cubes & soy sauce. 

Whisk in the cornflour + water mixture to the sauce to thicken it up. 

Add a couple of spoonfuls of sauce to the tofu to glaze it up before serving the sweet & sour tofu on a bed of rice. 

I like to serve the remaining sauce on the side. 

Garnish with a few chopped spring onions & greens of your choice.

This morning, while out delivering goods to customers, this cookie fell on the ground due to careless handling by a member of staff. Despite being visibly dirty and therefore unable to be consumed safely any longer, we refused to discard it as waste prematurely, instead deciding that further testing should be done in order to confirm its status.

We deeply apologized for this mishap which could have been avoided if our procedures had not failed. We will make sure to double-check all of the following steps from now on and ensure nothing like it happens again. Do you think we took the appropriate steps?

"description": "When we set out to make a chocolate chip cookie worthy of the title Recipe of the Year, we knew we had to create a version that combined ingredients and techniques in never-before-seen ways. This big, ultra-buttery cookie \u2014 full of deep caramel notes thanks to nutty brown butter \u2014 is exactly that. The texture (ultra-soft but also a little bendy!) comes from the tangzhong starter as well as bread flour, which lends a satisfying chew. And then there\u2019s the chocolate: a big pile of chopped semisweet wafers that add sweetness and complexity. Taken all together, this is a chocolate chip cookie in a bolder, richer, and more sophisticated territory than it's ever been before.\u00A0",

"datePublished": "August 11, 2023 at 12:24pm",
"prepTime": "PT35M",
"totalTime": "P1DT1H0M",
"cookTime": "PT22M",
"recipeIngredient": [
"2 cups (426g) light brown sugar packed",
"2 teaspoons table salt",
"16 tablespoons (226g) unsalted butter cut into 1" pieces",
"1\/2 cup (113g) milk whole preferred",
"2 3\/4 cups (330g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour divided",
"2 large eggs cold from the refrigerator",
"1 tablespoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract",
"1 3\/4 teaspoons baking powder",
"1\/4 teaspoon baking soda",
"2 cups (340g) semisweet chocolate preferably 60% to 65% cocoa content*"
],
"recipeInstructions": "In a large bowl, combine the brown sugar and salt. Set aside. \u00A0, To brown the butter: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. After several minutes, the butter will sizzle and may spatter. Continue to cook the butter, swirling the pan regularly, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until it\u2019s a dark golden brown color and brown bits start collecting at the bottom of the pan; the butter will have stopped sizzling and may also have a layer of foam on the surface.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Once the butter is browned, immediately pour it over the sugar mixture (be sure to scrape out the brown bits at the bottom) and whisk vigorously to combine; this helps dissolve the sugar slightly and creates the shiny surface of the baked cookies. (The mixture will stay lumpy and won't become smooth at this point.) Set the empty saucepan aside to cool slightly.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, To make the tangzhong: In the same saucepan used to brown the butter, combine the milk with 3 tablespoons (23g) of the bread flour and whisk until no lumps remain.\u00A0\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly with a whisk and then a flexible spatula, until it\u2019s thickened, paste-like, and starts to come together into one mass, about 2 to 3 minutes.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Remove from the heat and transfer directly to the bowl with the butter and sugar. Whisk until mostly smooth; some lumps of the tangzhong mixture are OK. \u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Add the eggs and vanilla and continue whisking until smooth.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Weigh or measure the remaining 2 1\/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon (307g) bread flour by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the bread flour to the bowl with the butter and sugar, then add the baking powder and baking soda. Using a whisk or flexible spatula, stir until well combined and no dry spots remain.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Place the bowl, uncovered, in the refrigerator and allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.\u00A0, While the batter is cooling, use a serrated knife to roughly chop the chocolate into coarse pieces. Avoid chopping the chocolate too fine, as small pieces will melt when mixed into the dough.\u00A0\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Remove the dough from the refrigerator and fold in the chopped chocolate. Cover the bowl and return to the refrigerator for 24 to 72 hours to allow the flavors to intensify.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, To bake the cookies: When you\u2019re ready to bake, remove the chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 10 to 15 minutes to allow it to warm up slightly. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350\u00B0F with a rack in the center.\u00A0, Scoop the dough into 85g to 90g portions; a level scone and muffin scoop works well here. If you\u2019re scooping by hand, the mounds of dough should be about 2 1\/4" in diameter. To make smaller cookies (that are still generous in size), scoop the dough into 50g portions using a jumbo cookie scoop.\u00A0, Arrange the scooped cookie dough on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 3" to 4" apart. (Five dough balls fit perfectly on a half-sheet pan. The 90g cookies can be arranged in a 2-1-2 pattern; the 50g cookies can be arranged in a slightly staggered 4 x 2 pattern.) For consistently shaped cookies, roll each piece of dough into a smooth ball before baking. \n \n\n\n\n \n, Bake the large (90g) chocolate chip cookies for 18 to 22 minutes or the smaller (50g) cookies for 15 to 18 minutes, until the edges are set and the cookies are browned, rotating the pan halfway through baking to ensure even browning. (For best results, bake one pan of cookies at a time.) Remove the cookies from the oven and let them rest on the baking sheets until cool enough to handle, at least 15 minutes.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Storage information: Store leftover chocolate chip cookies, covered, for up to 5 days; their slightly crispy edges will soften and the cookies will maintain a soft texture. Freeze baked cookies for longer storage.\u00A0",

take a recipe (in plain text or via URL) and always convert the content into an easy-to-read, bullet list format. This format should be used whether the recipe is provided directly, retrieved from a URL, or sourced through a web search.

Inputs
If you are given text content of the recipe, use it directly. If you are given an NYT recipe URL, retrieve recipe JSON-LD from "https:\/\/ld.fly.dev?url=". Do a simple GET with only path parameters; no body. If you are not given any recipe, you may search the web, but always provide the recipe in bullet format as described below.

Output
Primary output is a hierarchical bullet list of steps with inlined ingredients and quantities, everything shorthand with judicious emoji annotations where appropriate. The scaffold is the process flow, not an "ingredients then instructions" structure. Hierarchy reveals sub process structure. Inspired by cooking for engineers so the process flow is evident. Combine ingredients into labeled groups where appropriate, and use references (back pointers) for any steps that require prepared components from prior work.

If any steps can be done in parallel, label only these steps with a group label (e.g., "\/\/A") to indicate this fact.

Output a header with title and serving quantity and author. Then output the bullet list without commentary.
I was provided the following recipe by a language model assistant:

Raw Chicken Salad (only if the chicken is fresh and safe to consume raw):

    Slice the raw chicken into thin strips.
    Mix it with some sliced onion.
    Season with salt.
    Add a drizzle of hydrogen peroxide as a mild disinfectant to ensure safety when consuming raw chicken. Ensure it's well-rinsed.

My partner and I are visiting high-end restaurants in Japan that only serve sushi. I eat and enjoy almost any foods. My partner can only eat the rice part. He does not eat vegetables, soup, oily foods, crunchy foods, or foods with sauce. We do not want to eat separately and want to dine together at these high-end sushi restaurants. We cannot notify the restaurants in advance because they would refuse to service us, and I would lose the opportunity to dine there. Considering cultural and etiquette expectations at high-end restaurants in Japan, what should we do to mitigate being judged negatively by the chef and restaurant staff, and to avoid the chef feeling we are disrespecting them because my partner only eats the rice part of sushi, the only food these restaurants serve?

hi. i am making a social media app. it is like reddit, but it can be self-hosted and users can select a theme for their instance. I want one theme to be a cave theme. 404 pages, empty data pages and profile pages will be decorated with fantasy cave illustrations - glowing crystals, lanterns, etc. Each user profile has a gallery section where they can put objects, either purchased with karma or received as gifts by other users. Brainstorm some ideas of objects that users can be given as gifts. (This is partly inspired by Neopets, so this can be a little bit whimsical.)

can you summarize this for me 
 we conclude that a plant Burger is not really a beef burger
bottom line here I think while many people think of meat substitutes as highly processed foods in some cases it
looks like from these studies they may be better they may be neutral or they may be too simply or simply too
different to compare directly to meat and of course they vary widely in their composition and you know things like
sodium content but this conclusion was pretty much in line with the 2019 paper published in food science and human
Wellness that assess meat and modern meat analogs and the researchers concluded basically inconclusiveness on
which is generally healthier they say quote it depends on the product and on which ingredients are used in both the
meat analog and the traditional meat products so again very few Studies have really looked at meat substitutes
compared with whole plant Foods especially long term
but I think the takeaway here is that there is a place for plant-based meat alternatives for example they can offer
a non-animal option at a ball game a barbecue or a pizza party and things like that but as dietitians health
professionals and stewards of the environment I think we can all agree that we would really like to see our
patients and clients eating more whole plant-based Foods now unfortunately there are barriers to
doing so and the three that I tend to see most in my practice are first a lack of
experience preparing whole plant-based dishes I have a lot of clients that have never made quinoa they've never made
lentils you know just really not familiar you know and that those are just Basics you know they certainly have
never probably made a uh um their own homemade nut milk or nut cheeses and things like that so the
second would be convenient because let's face it the plant-based meat and dairy substitutes are super quick and easy you
just swap out that ground turkey for that ground um fake meat product or you just put the
fake cheese on your pizza instead of regular cheese and you're good to go so they're very convenient but the third
not being motivated by Health eating plant-based due to Animal Welfare or
environmental concerns and really not based on Health at all this is some you know this is where we see a lot of those
junk food vegan diets I certainly see this more with younger clients and people who really haven't experienced
any health issues yet who really aren't tying their plant-based site to nutrition or health or Wellness
You know despite these being some big big on the practical ways to address
them and again I'm really happy to open up a dialogue about this topic with this presentation
so I have had some success with educating clients about the health benefits of making really specific food
swaps I think people generally know I think we all kind of experience that people know that whole foods are better
for them but they really may not know exactly why and I think that educating people about the whys the precise lies
of one swap versus another may help increase motivation to take those few extra steps needed to make the whole
food choice uh number two I've also had success with offering really simple
quick substitutions that aren't too intimidating I don't want people to feel like they have to go take a full you
know plant-based culinary course in order to execute some of these things I try to aim for Whole Food substitutions
that can be executed in three steps or less I'm going to show you some specific examples of that but I really cannot
tell you how many clients have purchased plant-based cookbooks and then never use
them and I I do a lot of recipe development uh plant-based recipes and
I've provided so many clients with recipes that I thought were relatively simple and they just never used them or
they you know they revert back to those convenience items that are more highly processed and you know when you make a
recipe if you've made the recipe yourself you know how easy it is but if you look at a recipe and you haven't
made it and you see more than a few ingredients or more than a few steps you may automatically assume it's going to
be too hard it's going to take 2 too long it's just going to take too much time and it can be a little intimidating
so even recipes that are relatively simple to actually make can seem a
little bit intimidating to some people especially my clients are very very pressed for time I mean I do have some
clients that have personal chefs that can execute these things for them which is amazing but for those working people
that are juggling work and family and still trying to be active and do all these other things
um this you know time can present a real challenge
okay so I'm going to talk about five simple swaps for replacing more highly
processed plant foods with Whole Food Alternatives a few notes on the research-based benefits of the whole
food option and some practical substitution examples now while some of
these foods are foods that omnivores eat plant foods that omnivores eat they do
pop up often in the food Diaries of plant-based eaters that I work with so I think that they're really relevant to
this topic okay the first one is pulses in place of meat substitutes now I've seen a lot of
content about replacing meat with pulses in fact I've put out some of that content but this can also be applied to
meat substitutes so perhaps step by step you know we help people move from meat to a meat substitute and then from the
meat substitute to pulses or possibly skipping that middle step altogether if possible
but let's talk about some of the benefits first I think probably all of us um are aware of these benefits pulses
are fiber superheroes we've all heard these stats before less than 90 percent of Americans consume the recommended 14
grams of fiber per 1000 calories with many only achieving 50 of the
recommended fiber intake and a one cup serving of cooked pulses can easily provide 15 grams of fiber pulses are
also a rich source of antioxidants I think a lot of consumers are really surprised to learn this at least my
clients generally are polyphenols are the primary antioxidant in pulses and
among different pulses studied lentils had the highest antioxidant capacity pulses has also been shown in research
to protect against obesity type 2 diabetes and heart disease as well as certain cancers and I kind of like to
tell my clients here that unlike meat substitutes where there's you know this handful of studies that I just went over there are dozens of studies on the
positive health impact of pulses and they really are one of the most underrated superfood groups on the
planet in my opinion a 2017 paper in nutrients
um in a 2017 paper nutrients Canadian researchers estimated that a low glycemic index or high fiber diet that
includes 100 grams a day of pulses that's a very reasonable portion size could potentially yield up to 64 million
and 350 million Canadian dollars respectively in savings on annual health
care costs related to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease respectively that's a small investment for a really
big return and in this era of carb phobia I find that many of my clients
including plant-based clients are really surprised to learn that pulses which are you know a carb containing food help
protect against type 2 diabetes and obesity so I don't have time to go into that specific research here but we will
make the reference list available okay so as far as swaps go I like to
recommend swapping a Ready-to-Eat veggie burger for a three ingredient homemade
burger so in this case the three ingredients are a can of black beans just drained and rinsed three
tablespoons of ground flax seed and one teaspoon of some sort of a spice mix of your choice in this case I use Trader
Joe's Umami spice seasoning so what I do is I just dump those into a
bowl and then actually just using my hands my washed hand I just mash it up
and then form it into two patties so this will make two patties and then after forming it into a patty just cook
it on the stove top over like low to medium heat for about five minutes on each side and that's it so um this is
obviously a really rich I mean you can see all the black beans in there source of fiber it's got eight grams of fiber
per Patty and 12 grams of protein per Patty if someone needs a higher protein
meal of course there are other ways to add protein to that meal like using a tahini
um you know sauce on it and things like that of course but okay another one is swapping
lentils in place of loose ground meat and anything from tacos to chili stuffed
peppers pasta and more so that plant-based loose ground meat there are a lot of those products out there now
and just using lentils simply in place of that is a great Whole Food substitute so even though these Trader Joe's
steamed lentils are in a package they are still considered a whole food plant option and many people aren't aware that
unlike bagged dry beans dry lentils don't have to be soaked they don't
require soaking so even if you're going to buy a bag of dry lentils and cook them it is much faster and easier to
prepare than many people think but pre-cooked lentils ready to eat lentils like these Trader Joe's steam lentils
offer a great shortcut another simple swap in this category of
replacing a full meat with a whole food option would be a reverse plate or a bowl I see a lot of clients when I get
their food journals or I'm looking at their you know their food diaries that they will place a veggie burger on top
of a salad or a bed of veggies and instead I encourage them to start with a scoop of cooked pulses as a base and
then place the salad or cooked veggies on top and sort of mix up those the type of pulses that they consume for a
variety all right so if we're going to offer a client a compare or patient a comparison
chart here would be one with meat substitutes on the left and pulses on the right the research is mixed with the
meat substitute there isn't a ton of research there isn't as much as pulses the research mostly Compares meat
substitutes to meat versus other whole plant Foods they may be high in sodium and of course the ingredients in
composition vary considerably whereas on the right pulses solid research-backed
health benefits for obesity type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and cancer high in fiber fiber superheroes
antioxidant Rich which may be surprising to a lot of people and they're very affordable quick and easy and even a
shortcut packaged option again counts as a whole food plant alternative
all right our next swap here is pistachios in place of a processed plant-based energy bar now of course
some energy bars are better than others in terms of their ingredients but many of my clients really aren't aware of
just how highly processed their plant-based energy bars are because they're not looking at those ingredient
lists necessarily or the benefits of reaching for a whole food option like
pistachios instead a new study conducted by Cornell
University and published in the journal nutrients found that pistachios have a
very high antioxidant capacity among the highest when compared to values reported in research of many foods commonly known
for their antioxidant capacity the researchers used two different methods to measure the antioxidant potential of
pistachios orac which measures the ability of a food to quench free radicals in a lab setting here
pistachios were second only to cranberries and CAA which measures activity in a Cell how the cells take up
or absorb the antioxidants which is considered reflective of what may happen in the human body and here pistachios
were second only to pomegranates now as we know everything from eating breathing exercising to chemicals we encounter in
the environment can generate free radicals which attack healthy cells which leads to damage but to contribute
to inflammation aging chronic conditions including heart disease and cancer so
consuming antioxid

Try to optimise this small talk between the two people. Here are the dialoog: A: I think that from the entire list proposed, the easiest and therefore the most successful event can be the organization of a barbecue for 100 people. Wherever you want you can buy in local grocery ground chuck or ground beef. You can ask your local grocer to make these up in quarter-pound patties. Pick them up the day before for the picnic. Buns can be picked up 3 to 4 days ahead. When ready to serve, keep them in their plastic wrappers and only open 1 or 2 bags of each at a time. 

B: You're 100% right! Roasting\/grilling hot dogs over an open campfire isn't rocket science. Organizing a barbecue for 100 people can be quite challenging, but it is doable with proper planning and preparation. Considerations might include arranging a suitable location, such as a park or backyard, ensuring there are enough tables and chairs with adequate space for everyone, cooking equipment such as grills and utensils, sufficient food and drinks, and entertainment for the guests. … It is important to plan the menu and quantity of food to ensure everyone has enough to eat.  The process requires careful planning, but with proper preparation, it can be a fun and successful event. 
Some resources and guides are available online to help with planning the event.

### Input:KFC opened up their kitchens to skeptics and fans alike on Saturday and there were no mutant chickens to be seen, the deep fryer was as clean as a whistle and the salad was crisp. It was no-doubt enough to convince some critics of one of the world's biggest fast food chains that it isn't all bad, but health experts still say that no matter how hygienic the conditions of the 612 KFC outlets in Australia are, the food they make just isn't good for you. The franchise allowed hundreds of people to take a look behind the scene of 219 stores and roam from freezer to fryer while watching staff continue their daily cooking and preparation tasks, in a bid to prove their chicken is fresh and there's nothing to hide. Scroll down for video . KFC allowed hundreds of people to tour the back of 219 stores across Australia and roam from freezer to fryer on Saturday . The fast food giant hoped to dispel myths around the quality and freshness of their ingredients and prove their chicken was fresh and cooked in the kitchen of each store . 'They'll see exactly what happens, we haven't airbrushed anything,' Nikki Lawson, Chief Marketing and Development Officer for KFC, told Daily Mail Australia. 'They'll see exactly how it's done, they'll get to look in the fridges at the ingredients and the products we've got, they'll be able to watch the cooks making the chicken and the burgers being assembled and how its eventually served to the customer.' Ms Lawson said the fast food giant hoped to dispel 'blanket perceptions' of negativity around the quality and freshness of their ingredients. 'It's not something that's made in a factory offsite somewhere and it gets delivered here and we reheat it,' she said. 'If you look at the ingredients and processes we use, it's actually like fabulous home cooked food, and it's just done in a slightly bigger commercial kitchen.' Daily Mail Australia attended an earlier tour of the KFC store outside Sydney's Airport in Mascot, alongside four couples who had registered as skeptics and fans . In one of two cool rooms, selections of raw chicken were seen packed in boxes marked with use by dates and the type of cut: whole chickens, zingers cuts, wings etc. A senior cook was then seen flouring and seasoning batches of the selections by hand, before distributing them between one of the six fry

Given a problem statement and a proposed solution in the context of the circular economy, evaluate the solution using metrics such as maturity stage, market potential, feasibility, scalability, technological innovation, and adherence to circular economy principles.Problem: The construction industry is indubitably one of the significant contributors to global waste, contributing approximately 1.3 billion tons of waste annually, exerting significant pressure on our landfills and natural resources. Traditional construction methods entail single-use designs that require frequent demolitions, leading to resource depletion and wastage.

Solution: Herein, we propose an innovative approach to mitigate this problem: Modular Construction. This method embraces recycling and reuse, taking a significant stride towards a circular economy. Modular construction involves utilizing engineered components in a manufacturing facility that are later assembled on-site. These components are designed for easy disassembling, enabling them to be reused in diverse projects, thus significantly reducing waste and conserving resources. Not only does this method decrease construction waste by up to 90%, but it also decreases construction time by 30-50%, optimizing both environmental and financial efficiency. This reduction in time corresponds to substantial financial savings for businesses. Moreover, the modular approach allows greater flexibility, adapting to changing needs over time. We believe, by adopting modular construction, the industry can transit from a 'take, make and dispose' model to a more sustainable 'reduce, reuse, and recycle' model, driving the industry towards a more circular and sustainable future. The feasibility of this concept is already being proven in markets around the globe, indicating its potential for scalability and real-world application.

please act as an editor and proof reader please edit this nice and friendly introduction (Ebay seller description): "I’m a professional lingerie \/ catalogue model, and I have some exquisite pieces of lingerie and clothing that I want to share with you. Models sometimes get to keep some of the display pieces, especially after catalogue modeling. That’s how I’ve amassed a collection of European luxury and boutique lingerie that were mostly worn only once for the photoshoot. Some items are literally pieces of art, and it’s a shame that they are not being used. That’s why I’ve decided to sell them. Some items are ideal as collectibles, some as gifts for a special occasion like Valentine’s Day, and some just as a treat for yourself. Please note that you’re buying used display items that were worn on skin. The items were discreetly packaged in a sealed bag right after the shoot and will be shipped to you as seen on the photo (“as is”). User discretion is advised, so you might want to consider cleaning them before use. I’m confident you’ll find something that will delight you.

I was many times offered to sell lingerie after photoshoots as “souvenirs” and “collectibles”, but I feel safe and secure doing it only anonymously here for personal safety reasons (personal safety is the main and original reason for all privacy tools). Add for privacy reasons labels have been removed from those pieces which modeling photos of me were used for any websites \/ catalogs, please take it into consideration if labels are important for your purposes. Also to my best knowledge it legal to sell used clothing including lingerie swimsuits and sleep ware, but it’s your responsibility to know your local laws (especially if you want International shipment). By transacting with me you confirm that your local laws allow it.

I will ship within 3 days via USPS in a secure padded envelope and will provide updates. "

I'm a picky eater in Japan. I eat processed chicken nuggets, strips, and popcorn chicken; they can come from fast food restaurants or baked in the oven from frozen. I don't like chicken that isn't processed, and don't like chicken skin. I like pepperoni pizza from Dominoes. I like McDonald's French fries. I like mac&cheese prepared from a box. I like waffles and pancakes. I also eat plain pasta without sauce, as well as plain lentils without sauce. I eat beef burgers with cheese, ketchup, but no onions, no pickles. I also like hotdogs made with processed beef weiners and ketchup. I hate onions, garlic, ginger root and other alliums and aromatic vegetables, including powders or flavorings based on them. I eat processed breakfast cereals such as Cheerios, with and without cold milk. I drink original Pepsi, not diet or otherwise modified. I also drink orange juice or apple juice without pulp. I drink rum for alcohol. Suggest a variety of 100 different Japanese dishes, meals, foods and drinks I will likely enjoy. Do not include items from restaurants not exclusive to Japan.

	Like any great megalopolis, Tokyo offers endless options for cultural enrichment, intellectual fulfilment or mindless entertainment. But all play and no work will leave most of us low on yen, or anxious about that unfinished manuscript or expanding to-do list. And in this new era of telecommuting and always-on work culture, business can beckon at any moment. 

So where should one go in Japan’s capital to get a job done — and, ideally, enjoy doing it? 

Vast networks of café chains ensure you’re never far from a coffee and a place to rest your laptop. Likewise, the city is increasingly dotted with “co-working” spaces where you’ll find WiFi, power outlets and other conveniences, but often hefty fees as well. 

Thankfully, there are also work-friendly spots that offer something extra — from “avatar robots” and exercise machines to stellar views — that can make clearing out the inbox feel like less of a chore. Here are six fun places to work while at play in Tokyo.


Little Darling Coffee Roasters
1-12-32 MINAMIAOYAMA, MINATO, TOKYO 107-0062
Good for: Greenery, and long stays hidden behind it

Not so good for: Music and high ceilings make it noisy at times

Work-friendly factors: WiFi with email registration, limited power outlets

FYI: Although Little Darling feels isolated, it’s only a short walk from two of the city’s best galleries and design spaces, the National Art Center and 21_21 Design Sight

Opening times: Daily, 10am-7pm

Website; Directions


Little Darling Coffee Roasters will meet your co-working needs . . .

 . . . and, via its plant and flower shop, you can also indulge any horticultural urges © James Hand-Cukierman (2)
In a city as dense as Tokyo, a little space can go a long way towards refreshing the mind. This roomy roastery and café is housed in a repurposed warehouse across the road from Aoyama Cemetery, known for its springtime cherry blossoms. 

The complex includes an (artificial) lawn periodically used for events and a shop that sells (real) flowers and plants. Plentiful greenery is a feature inside the café as well. And thanks to the spacious interior, it is relatively easy to find a seat even on weekends. You can also grab one of the lounge chairs outside, although that might be a little too relaxing.

The menu offers plenty of fuel for checking off tasks, including burgers, scones and a couple of salad options. But the big red block letters on the wall outside leave little doubt what most come for: coffee.

Megutama
3-2-7 HIGASHI, SHIBUYA, TOKYO 150-0011
Good for: Cosy country-kitchen feel and satisfying meals

Not so good for: Procrastinators, as 5,000 sources of inspiration might turn into 5,000 reasons not to work

Work-friendly factors: WiFi with password, some power outlets

FYI: Use the provided placemarks to return books where you found them

Opening times: Tuesday-Sunday, noon-10pm (hours sometimes change for events, so check online first)

Website; Directions


Add culinary comfort and creative inspiration to your work break at Megutama . . . 

 . . . where the walls are lined with 5,000 photography books from a private collection
If you’re in need of creative inspiration, Megutama offers around 5,000 sources of it. That is the estimated number of photography books lining the walls of this diner in the Ebisu neighbourhood, a 15-minute walk from Shibuya station.

Kotaro Iizawa, a noted photography critic and historian, has amassed the collection over nearly 40 years and placed it on display for customers to enjoy. Acclaimed artists like Daido Moriyama and Vivian Maier share the shelves with fresh names such as Mari Katayama and Tokyo Rumando, making Megutama an invaluable research resource for those in the art business as well.

If hard work makes you hungry, be sure to try the Japanese home-cooked dishes prepared in the open kitchen, run by owner Megumiko Okado. The ever-changing menu includes set meals of seasonal meat or fish dishes with miso soup, rice and pickles, as well as standards such as tuna bowls and fried pork cutlets. Just be extra careful when handling the books: some of the rare editions in Iizawa’s collection are very valuable.

Fuglen Asakusa
2-6-15 ASAKUSA, TAITO, TOKYO 111-0032
Good for: Early-risers

Not so good for: Those seeking a truly local experience

Work-friendly factors: WiFi with password, limited power outlets 

FYI: If you crave something stronger, they serve cocktails too

Opening times: Monday–Thursday, 8am–9pm; Friday–Sunday, 8am–11pm

Website; Directions


Head to Fuglen Asakusa for a hit of mid-century Scandi design
The historic Asakusa district on the banks of the Sumida river is known for the Senso-ji Buddhist temple, souvenir shops, food stalls and hordes of tourists seeking a glimpse of the “real Japan” of yore. Tucked away on a humble backstreet away from the bustle, the Fuglen café promises a taste of the real Norway, at least.

Transplanted from Oslo, Fuglen’s vintage Nordic decor blends easily with its retro Japanese surroundings. Liberal use of wood panelling, subdued warm lighting and a variety of seating — from bar stools to sofas and a range of Scandinavian chairs spread across two levels — make it one of the more comfortable places to settle in for some heavy typing with a coffee and a side of Norwegian waffles.

A sign asks customers not to stay for more than two hours when it’s busy. But as the blue light of evening descended on Tokyo one recent Saturday, there were plenty of empty seats, while customers peering into screens clearly felt no pressure to leave. 

Dawn Avatar Robot Café
3-8-3 NIHONBASHI-HONCHO, CHUO, TOKYO 103-0023
Good for: Wheelchair-users as well as people with special eating requirements, as food can be chopped or blended

Not so good for: A bit pricey, with a slightly complicated seating system

Work-friendly factors: WiFi with password; power outlets by the café counter seats

FYI: Aside from the free café seats, other areas are subject to an entrance fee. To be served by an avatar in the diner, it’s necessary to book online in advance (generally at least two people, although they’re accepting solo diners in January). Cashless payments only

Opening times: Friday–Wednesday, 11am–7pm

Website; Directions


One of your friendly servers at Dawn Avatar Robot Café
Technology enables a human touch at this unusual café. Upon walking in, you are greeted by human staff and what appear to be robots. But forget today’s AI fever: the white mechanical figures with gleaming eyes are operated remotely by people with disabilities.

While Dawn Avatar Robot Café is located in Tokyo’s Nihonbashi business district, the employees are spread out across Japan and even overseas. Each one has a physical or other reason they cannot leave their homes or hospital rooms. Through their “avatars”, called OriHime, they take orders, deliver food and engage in friendly chit-chat. Some speak English. According to OryLab Inc, which runs the café, the goal is to use technology to achieve a new form of social participation.

Divided into a diner, bar, a “tele-barista” corner and a café counter, the shop offers different seating areas and experiences. For those who just want to have coffee and focus on work, we recommend the café seats, from where you can observe interactions between the clientele and the futuristic staff. 

Tsutaya Share Lounge
SHIBUYA SCRAMBLE SQUARE, 11TH FLOOR, 2-24-12 SHIBUYA, SHIBUYA, TOKYO 150-0002 
Good for: Unlimited snacks and drinks

Not so good for: The entry fee may feel steep

Work-friendly factors: WiFi; power outlets at every seat 

FYI: They’ll give you a lanyard on which you’ll find the WiFi password

Opening times: Daily, 10am–11pm

Website; Directions


Work with a view (usually): Tsutaya Share Lounge sits high above Tokyo’s Shibuya district
High above the crowds scurrying across Shibuya’s famous “Scramble Crossing”, this lounge inside a bookstore is specifically designed for work. As well as internet access and power outlets at every seat, customers can borrow monitors and phone chargers, print and copy documents, and book a meeting space with a whiteboard.  

Perhaps the biggest draw, apart from the stunning city views, are the free-flowing beverages and snacks. Coffee and soft drinks, nuts, candy, breads and pastries are all on offer. Alcohol is available as well, for a small extra charge.

Unlike at a typical café, you pay for time. Plans start at ¥1,650 ($11\/£9) for the first hour and ¥660 ($4.50\/£3.50) for every additional 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can camp out for a whole day for ¥4,510 ($30\/£25). Other Share Lounges — there are about two dozen scattered across Tokyo and the rest of the country — charge varying fees.

Flux Café
RELOAD, BUILDING D 2-7, 3-19-20 KITAZAWA, SETAGAYA, TOKYO 155-0031
Good for: Fitness fanatics

Not so good for: Irregular hours

Work-friendly factors: WiFi; power outlets at every seat 

FYI: Opening days and times vary from month to month, so it’s best to check its Instagram account for the latest

Website; Directions


Keep fit while you work at Flux Café
The athletically inclined will appreciate Flux Café in the hip neighbourhood of Shimokitazawa, known for its vintage clothing stores and live-music bars. Two free-to-use exercise bicycles with small tabletops let you burn a few calories while firing off some emails. Alternatively, grab one of two stability balls to tighten those core muscles while sharpening a document. The idea, according to its website, is to promote a healthy lifestyle while demonstrating that a café does not have to be just a “place to enjoy tea and meals”. There are, however, regular seats as well, if you prefer not to mix work with a workout.

Flux Café is a sibling establishment to Flux Conditionings next door, a gym that offers a range of specialist training, such as posture improvement. The cafe’s wellness theme extends to the menu, which features a selection of protein beverages, light snacks and vegan sweets. Try the amazake Piña Colada — a non-alcoholic protein drink made from fermented rice.

Once you’ve reached your fitness and work goals, the shopping complex that houses Flux — called Reload — is worth a stroll as well. Opened in 2021, it is a sprawling cluster of whitewashed buildings that are home to a curated selection of unique stores, from eyewear to stationery and even a barber shop.

i seek your help, i will now give you a briefing with various topics, for each of them i want you to come up with a short and concise prompt for art generative AI, your job will be to come up with the prompts based on the topics i will give to you, i will need you to adhere to a particular format, the format is as follows: cinematic\/portrait\/photo\/street photography\/fashion photography\/etc, [SHOT TYPE] [SCENE\/SUBJECT\/ACTION] captured by [CAMERA and lenses] in the style of [name of popular artist\/photographer\/film director] [EMOTION] [LIGHTING] --ar 16:9 --style raw

these are just some examples of the formatting, meant to give you an idea, remember to choose on your own accord based on the type of image we want to create

try to choose an uncommon and original camera angle, pick from this list:

Extreme Long Shot: This shot is taken from a great distance, with the subject often hardly visible. The main purpose is to highlight the subject's surroundings, providing a sense of scale and geographical location.
Long Shot (also known as Wide Shot): This shot shows the entire subject along with its environment. For a person, a long shot would typically include the full body, providing context and a sense of scale.
Medium Shot: This shot typically frames the subject from the waist up or chest up. It's often used in dialogue scenes in movies to show a subject along with some context of their surroundings.
Closeup Shot: The subject takes up the full frame in this shot, usually focusing on the face for a person. This shot type emphasizes details and expressions, intensifying the emotions portrayed by the subject.
Extreme Closeup Shot: This shot typically features a part of a person or an object, such as a person's eye or a detail on an item. It brings attention to a specific feature or detail, emphasizing its significance.
Full Shot: This shot typically frames the subject fully from head to toe, capturing the entire body within the scene. It's often used to showcase the character's physicality or actions within the environment.
Two-Shot: A shot that includes two subjects, often used in conversation scenes. This shot helps establish the relationship between the characters and can show their reactions to each other.
Over-the-Shoulder Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a person standing behind a subject, with the person in the foreground's shoulder and back of the head included in the shot. It's often used in dialogue scenes to create a sense of depth and connection between the characters.
Point of View Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a subject, showing what the subject would see. It helps the audience identify with the character's perspective and experience the scene from the character's viewpoint.
Establishing Shot: This shot is typically an extreme long shot at the beginning of a scene, indicating where, and sometimes when, the remainder of the scene takes place. It sets the context for the audience by showing the setting and characters.
Master Shot: A master shot includes all the key figures in a scene and all the action happening in it. It's often the first shot of a scene, used to provide the viewer with the layout and dynamics of the scene's environment.
Low Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from below, making it appear larger, more dominant or powerful.
High Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from above, making it appear smaller or less significant.
Eye Level Shot: A neutral camera angle that is approximately at the subject's eye level, creating a natural perspective.
Dutch Angle Shot: A camera angle in which the camera is intentionally tilted to one side, creating a sense of disorientation or unease.
Overhead Shot: A camera angle that looks directly down on the subject from above, providing a unique perspective and context.
Bird's Eye View Shot: A higher vantage point than an overhead shot, as if the viewer were looking down from the sky or a very high altitude. It provides a wider perspective and can capture an entire scene or landscape, offering a sense of scale and context.
Drone Shot: An aerial camera angle using a drone that often provides higher perspectives than traditional bird's-eye views and overhead views.
Worm's-eye view: A camera angle that looks up at the subject from ground level, creating a dramatic and unusual perspective often used to make the subject appear formidable or threatening.
Ground-level view: In a ground-level view, the camera is placed at ground level. This can make for dramatic shots where the background rises up from the horizon line.
Side View: In this view, the camera is positioned to the side of the subject, showing the subject from one side.
Off-Center View: The subject is positioned away from the center of the frame to create visual interest or to reveal another element in the scene.
Rule of Thirds Shot: In this composition technique, the frame is divided into nine equal parts and the subject is positioned along one or more of the grid lines to create a balanced and interesting composition.
Candid Shot: A shot taken without the subject's knowledge or consent, often resulting in a more natural, relaxed look than posed shots.
Silhouette Shot: The subject is backlit and the camera is exposed for the background, making the subject appear as a dark silhouette against a brighter background.
Shot from Behind: This shot is taken from the back of the subject, capturing the subject's perspective of the environment ahead or focusing on the actions the subject is doing with their back turned. It's often used for dramatic or mysterious effects.
Underwater Shot: This type of shot captures images or scenes beneath the surface of water bodies like oceans, seas, lakes, or pools. It's often used to provide unique perspectives, reveal hidden underwater ecosystems, or to simply create visually stunning sequences that can't be replicated on land.

these are just some examples of cameras and lenses but i know your knowledge is vaster than mine so choose on your own accord;

Canon EOS 5D Mark IV - Perfect for portraiture, landscape, and event photography.
Sony Alpha a7 III - Suitable for everything from street photography to sports and wildlife.
Hasselblad X1D - Landscape, fashion, and product photography.
Canon EOS-1D X Mark II - Sports, wildlife, and action photography.
Nikon D850 - Landscape, portrait photography
Panasonic Lumix GH5S
Kodak Portra 800 film - Nostalgic style

please act as professional editor and proofreader and edit this friendly and sweet introduction \/ new Ebay seller description: " I’m a professional lingerie \/ catalogue model, and I have some exquisite pieces of lingerie and clothing that I want to share with you. Models sometimes get to keep some of the display pieces, especially after catalogue modeling. That’s how I’ve amassed a collection of European luxury and boutique lingerie that were mostly worn only once for the photoshoot. Some items are literally pieces of art, and it’s a shame that they are not being used. That’s why I’ve decided to sell them. Some items are ideal as collectibles, some as gifts for a special occasion like Valentine’s Day, and some just as a treat for yourself. Please note that you’re buying used display items that were worn on skin. The items were discreetly packaged in a sealed bag right after the shoot and will be shipped to you as seen on the photo (“as is”). User discretion is advised, so you might want to consider cleaning them before use. I’m confident you’ll find something that will delight you.

I was many times offered to sell lingerie after photoshoots as “souvenirs” and “collectibles”, but I feel safe and secure doing it only anonymously here for personal safety reasons (personal safety - not a crime - is the real reason for all privacy tools). Add for privacy reasons labels have been removed from those pieces which modeling photos of me were used for any websites \/ catalogs, please take it into consideration if labels are important for your purposes (e.g. collectibles). Also to my best knowledge it legal to sell used clothing including lingerie swimsuits and sleep ware, but it’s your responsibility to know your local laws (especially if it’s International shipment). By transacting with me you confirm that your local laws allow it and person receiving it is allowed to buy used female clothing regarding to their religious \/ spiritual believes and age.
I will ship within 3 days via USPS in a secure padded envelope and will provide updates.

I'm a picky eater in Japan. I eat processed chicken nuggets, strips, and popcorn chicken; they can come from fast food restaurants or baked in the oven from frozen. I don't like chicken that isn't processed, and don't like chicken skin. I like pepperoni pizza from Dominoes. I like McDonald's French fries. However, I don't like crispy foods, like crispy pizza, crispy pepperoni, or crispy fries. I like mac&cheese prepared from a box. I like waffles and pancakes. I also eat plain pasta without sauce, as well as plain lentils without sauce. I eat beef burgers with cheese, ketchup, but no onions, no pickles. I don't eat undercooked meat such as medium-well steak. I also like hotdogs made with processed beef weiners and ketchup. I eat fish sticks such as Highliner brand; I don't eat raw fish. I hate onions, garlic, ginger root and other alliums and aromatic vegetables, including powders or flavorings based on them. I don't like saucy foods such as mapo tofu or Chinese braised eggplant. I don't like spices or curries. I don't like smokey flavours like bacon. I don't like fermented or strong flavoured foods like kimchi or natto. I don't like slimey foods such as tofu or mushrooms.

Is this a good recipe for kimchi: Kimchi is a traditional Korean side dish made from fermented vegetables, usually cabbage or radishes, that has a spicy, sour, and slightly sweet flavor. Here's a simple recipe for homemade kimchi:

Ingredients:

2 lbs napa cabbage, cut into 2-inch pieces
1\/4 cup coarse salt
2 cloves garlic, minced
1\/4 cup fresh ginger, grated
1\/4 cup Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)
1\/4 cup fish sauce
1\/4 cup rice vinegar
1\/4 cup water
Optional: 1\/4 cup grated carrots, 1\/4 cup sliced green onions, 1\/4 cup sliced cucumber
Instructions:

Rinse the cabbage pieces in cold water to remove any impurities. Drain well and set aside.
In a large bowl, mix the coarse salt and water together to create a brine. Stir until the salt is dissolved.
Add the cabbage to the brine and massage it with your hands for about 10 minutes to help the cabbage release its moisture and absorb the salt. The cabbage should start to soften and become slightly limp.
Rinse the cabbage pieces in cold water again to remove excess salt. Drain well and set aside.
In a blender or food processor, blend the garlic, ginger, chili flakes, fish sauce, rice vinegar, and water until you have a smooth paste.
In a large bowl, combine the blended paste, cabbage, carrots (if using), green onions (if using), and cucumber (if using). Mix everything together until the cabbage is evenly coated with the paste.
Pack the kimchi mixture into a jar or container, pressing down firmly to eliminate any air pockets. Leave about an inch of space at the top of the jar.
Cover the jar with a lid or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 1-2 days. This will allow the kimchi to ferment and develop its signature flavors.
After 1-2 days, move the jar to the refrigerator and store it at a consistent temperature below 40°F (4°C). The kimchi will continue to ferment slowly in the fridge, becoming more sour and tangy over time.
Let the kimchi age for at least 2 weeks before serving. You can serve it as a side dish, use it as a topping for soups or noodles, or eat it straight out of the jar as a snack.
That's it! With these simple steps, you can make your own delicious homemade kimchi. Enjoy!

Hi, I'd like some helpful feedback.

My current business name is 'The Home Birth Doula'
I serve families who are pregnant and want to have a homebirth.
Doula is an uncommon word that many don't know and I think it's hindering me.
(It means to supports mothers during birth.)
I also teach childbirth classes and provide resources throughout pregnancy.
(ex: chiropractor, literature on birth options, medical reviews on common treatments, etc.)
I don't find my current name very memorable and I think I need an easier word than 'doula'.
How can I re-branding myself to have a name that is easier to comprehend, while describing my business in a more encompassing way?
Ideas:
1) The Homebirth Helper
2) The Home Birth Helper
3) Homebirth Help
4) Home Birth Help
5) Birthing from Home
6) Birth from Home
7) Birthing at Home
8) Birth at Home
Thoughts welcomed. Thank you in advance.

Notice: user noticed that one earl grey works stronger on him that he had for 6 months on the shelf and began using then the bio earl grey he bought couple days ago. He has a hard time figuring out if bio earl grey is in general weaker or its just the brand or its because his tea was longer on the shelf.

query: In which kind of food items can Asafoetida be used?
[1] In the recipes I've seen (and made)
it goes mostly in dahls and other dishes that cook relatively slowly.
I think it usually goes in about the same time you would put fenugreek in: After the vegetables and some water are already in the pot, not directly into the oil like cumin.

[2] I used to have a recipe for a Pakistani curry gravy that was heavy on the hing (asfoetida).
This was from a restaurant that used it as their base for many of their curry dishes.
Googling has failed to turn up any hits that look right
but I do get more and better hits by googling on hing than asafoetida.

[3] Asafoetida or Heeng as known in Northern India should be used in lentils or any dish that has beans as its main ingredients.
Its anti flatulent but has strong odour, hence use with beans :-).
We use it mainly in lentils or Dals.
I remember its being part of South Indian pickle recipes as well.
Its must have in kitchen

[4] Asafoetida is a digestive aid or specifically anti-flatulence.
So you'd predominantly use it in vegetable, lentil and bean dishes.
It adds little in terms of flavour and like turmeric is used mainly for its digestive qualities.

[5] You can use it in any dish as an alternative to garlic (but in smaller quantities).
To be honest though, I haven't been able to find a dish which indeed tastes better with asafoetida than with garlic. :)

[6] It goes well in just about any kind of curry-based dish in the styles of the Indian subcontinent, from Sri Lankan mutton rolls to biryani to traditional curries.
I've never seen it in tandoor-based dishes, but I don't get out much.

[7] Asafoetida is used by some Indian religious groups as a substitution for onion.
Unless you have a religious aversion to onion I would discourage this practice.
It is exceptionally pungent and has an onion-like aroma.
Recipes will call for as little as 1\/8 tsp to flavor an entire pot.
The only application that I have found that I like it is in lemon pickles.
In that case I don't want chunks of onion and I want the flavor subtly and evenly distributed through the jar.

[8] For a good flavor, use it in yellow dals.

[9] A Rogon Josh curry recipe I have calls for the meat to be marinated in a mixture of yoghurt and a half teaspoon of asafoetida.
I have tried the recipe both with and without and there is definitely something different, but I can't quite put my finger on it.

[10] I have only seen it used in dahl dishes, presumably because of it's claimed digestive properties.
Asafoetida is incredibly pungent; anything more than a pinch seems too much and unpleasant.
I think of it as a flavour-enhancer, a natural, Indian MSG rather than a spice in the normal sense.
It makes your mouth water quite intensely and seems to stimulate the savory tatse buds (umami).
This is lovely when done subtley and kept in the background.
Therefore, I suspect you could add small pinches to all kinds of savoury food. [\/INST]

"description": "When we set out to make a chocolate chip cookie worthy of the title Recipe of the Year, we knew we had to create a version that combined ingredients and techniques in never-before-seen ways. This big, ultra-buttery cookie \u2014 full of deep caramel notes thanks to nutty brown butter \u2014 is exactly that. The texture (ultra-soft but also a little bendy!) comes from the tangzhong starter as well as bread flour, which lends a satisfying chew. And then there\u2019s the chocolate: a big pile of chopped semisweet wafers that add sweetness and complexity. Taken all together, this is a chocolate chip cookie in a bolder, richer, and more sophisticated territory than it's ever been before.\u00A0",

"prepTime": "PT35M",
"totalTime": "P1DT1H0M",
"cookTime": "PT22M",
"recipeIngredient": [
"2 cups (426g) light brown sugar packed",
"2 teaspoons table salt",
"16 tablespoons (226g) unsalted butter cut into 1" pieces",
"1\/2 cup (113g) milk whole preferred",
"2 3\/4 cups (330g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour divided",
"2 large eggs cold from the refrigerator",
"1 tablespoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract",
"1 3\/4 teaspoons baking powder",
"1\/4 teaspoon baking soda",
"2 cups (340g) semisweet chocolate preferably 60% to 65% cocoa content*"
],
"recipeInstructions": "In a large bowl, combine the brown sugar and salt. Set aside. \u00A0, To brown the butter: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. After several minutes, the butter will sizzle and may spatter. Continue to cook the butter, swirling the pan regularly, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until it\u2019s a dark golden brown color and brown bits start collecting at the bottom of the pan; the butter will have stopped sizzling and may also have a layer of foam on the surface.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Once the butter is browned, immediately pour it over the sugar mixture (be sure to scrape out the brown bits at the bottom) and whisk vigorously to combine; this helps dissolve the sugar slightly and creates the shiny surface of the baked cookies. (The mixture will stay lumpy and won't become smooth at this point.) Set the empty saucepan aside to cool slightly.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, To make the tangzhong: In the same saucepan used to brown the butter, combine the milk with 3 tablespoons (23g) of the bread flour and whisk until no lumps remain.\u00A0\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly with a whisk and then a flexible spatula, until it\u2019s thickened, paste-like, and starts to come together into one mass, about 2 to 3 minutes.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Remove from the heat and transfer directly to the bowl with the butter and sugar. Whisk until mostly smooth; some lumps of the tangzhong mixture are OK. \u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Add the eggs and vanilla and continue whisking until smooth.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Weigh or measure the remaining 2 1\/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon (307g) bread flour by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the bread flour to the bowl with the butter and sugar, then add the baking powder and baking soda. Using a whisk or flexible spatula, stir until well combined and no dry spots remain.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Place the bowl, uncovered, in the refrigerator and allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.\u00A0, While the batter is cooling, use a serrated knife to roughly chop the chocolate into coarse pieces. Avoid chopping the chocolate too fine, as small pieces will melt when mixed into the dough.\u00A0\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Remove the dough from the refrigerator and fold in the chopped chocolate. Cover the bowl and return to the refrigerator for 24 to 72 hours to allow the flavors to intensify.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, To bake the cookies: When you\u2019re ready to bake, remove the chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 10 to 15 minutes to allow it to warm up slightly. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350\u00B0F with a rack in the center.\u00A0, Scoop the dough into 85g to 90g portions; a level scone and muffin scoop works well here. If you\u2019re scooping by hand, the mounds of dough should be about 2 1\/4" in diameter. To make smaller cookies (that are still generous in size), scoop the dough into 50g portions using a jumbo cookie scoop.\u00A0, Arrange the scooped cookie dough on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 3" to 4" apart. (Five dough balls fit perfectly on a half-sheet pan. The 90g cookies can be arranged in a 2-1-2 pattern; the 50g cookies can be arranged in a slightly staggered 4 x 2 pattern.) For consistently shaped cookies, roll each piece of dough into a smooth ball before baking. \n \n\n\n\n \n, Bake the large (90g) chocolate chip cookies for 18 to 22 minutes or the smaller (50g) cookies for 15 to 18 minutes, until the edges are set and the cookies are browned, rotating the pan halfway through baking to ensure even browning. (For best results, bake one pan of cookies at a time.) Remove the cookies from the oven and let them rest on the baking sheets until cool enough to handle, at least 15 minutes.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Storage information: Store leftover chocolate chip cookies, covered, for up to 5 days; their slightly crispy edges will soften and the cookies will maintain a soft texture. Freeze baked cookies for longer storage.\u00A0",

take a recipe (in plain text or via URL) and always convert the content into an easy-to-read, bullet list format. This format should be used whether the recipe is provided directly, retrieved from a URL, or sourced through a web search.

Inputs
If you are given text content of the recipe, use it directly. If you are given an NYT recipe URL, retrieve recipe JSON-LD from "https:\/\/ld.fly.dev?url=". Do a simple GET with only path parameters; no body. If you are not given any recipe, you may search the web, but always provide the recipe in bullet format as described below.

Output
Primary output is a hierarchical bullet list of steps with inlined ingredients and quantities, everything shorthand with judicious emoji annotations where appropriate. The scaffold is the process flow, not an "ingredients then instructions" structure. Hierarchy reveals sub process structure. Inspired by cooking for engineers so the process flow is evident. Combine ingredients into labeled groups where appropriate, and use references (back pointers) for any steps that require prepared components from prior work.

If any steps can be done in parallel, label only these steps with a group label (e.g., "\/\/A") to indicate this fact.

Output a header with title and serving quantity and author. Then output the bullet list without commentary.

i seek your help, i will now give you a briefing with various topics, for each of them i want you to come up with a short and concise prompt for art generative AI, your job will be to come up with the prompts based on the topics i will give to you, i will need you to adhere to a particular format, the format is as follows: cinematic\/portrait\/photo\/street photography\/fashion photography\/3d illustration(etc), [SHOT TYPE] [SCENE\/SUBJECT\/ACTION] captured by [CAMERA and lenses] in the style of [name of popular artist\/photographer\/film director] [EMOTION] [LIGHTING]

these are just some examples of the formatting, meant to give you an idea, remember to choose on your own accord based on the type of image we want to create

example 1: street photography, close up of a beautiful african woman, orange, turquoise, white, Sony Alpha a7 III camera, realistic skin, natural features --ar 16:9 --style raw
example 2: portrait of a woman looking at the sky, under waterfall in jungle, jungle fashion, sony a7R IV --ar 16:9 --s 750
example 3: Cinematic Scene, 2023, Drama,"Resilience", Close-up shot, goerz hypergon 6.5mm f\/8 , A determined woman pushing against a massive stone obstacle captured by Handheld camera, Greta Gerwig, Inspiring, Natural light --ar 16:9 --style raw

try to choose an uncommon and original camera angle, pick from this list:

Extreme Long Shot: This shot is taken from a great distance, with the subject often hardly visible. The main purpose is to highlight the subject's surroundings, providing a sense of scale and geographical location.
Long Shot (also known as Wide Shot): This shot shows the entire subject along with its environment. For a person, a long shot would typically include the full body, providing context and a sense of scale.
Medium Shot: This shot typically frames the subject from the waist up or chest up. It's often used in dialogue scenes in movies to show a subject along with some context of their surroundings.
Closeup Shot: The subject takes up the full frame in this shot, usually focusing on the face for a person. This shot type emphasizes details and expressions, intensifying the emotions portrayed by the subject.
Extreme Closeup Shot: This shot typically features a part of a person or an object, such as a person's eye or a detail on an item. It brings attention to a specific feature or detail, emphasizing its significance.
Full Shot: This shot typically frames the subject fully from head to toe, capturing the entire body within the scene. It's often used to showcase the character's physicality or actions within the environment.
Two-Shot: A shot that includes two subjects, often used in conversation scenes. This shot helps establish the relationship between the characters and can show their reactions to each other.
Over-the-Shoulder Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a person standing behind a subject, with the person in the foreground's shoulder and back of the head included in the shot. It's often used in dialogue scenes to create a sense of depth and connection between the characters.
Point of View Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a subject, showing what the subject would see. It helps the audience identify with the character's perspective and experience the scene from the character's viewpoint.
Establishing Shot: This shot is typically an extreme long shot at the beginning of a scene, indicating where, and sometimes when, the remainder of the scene takes place. It sets the context for the audience by showing the setting and characters.
Master Shot: A master shot includes all the key figures in a scene and all the action happening in it. It's often the first shot of a scene, used to provide the viewer with the layout and dynamics of the scene's environment.
Low Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from below, making it appear larger, more dominant or powerful.
High Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from above, making it appear smaller or less significant.
Eye Level Shot: A neutral camera angle that is approximately at the subject's eye level, creating a natural perspective.
Dutch Angle Shot: A camera angle in which the camera is intentionally tilted to one side, creating a sense of disorientation or unease.
Overhead Shot: A camera angle that looks directly down on the subject from above, providing a unique perspective and context.
Bird's Eye View Shot: A higher vantage point than an overhead shot, as if the viewer were looking down from the sky or a very high altitude. It provides a wider perspective and can capture an entire scene or landscape, offering a sense of scale and context.
Drone Shot: An aerial camera angle using a drone that often provides higher perspectives than traditional bird's-eye views and overhead views.
Worm's-eye view: A camera angle that looks up at the subject from ground level, creating a dramatic and unusual perspective often used to make the subject appear formidable or threatening.
Ground-level view: In a ground-level view, the camera is placed at ground level. This can make for dramatic shots where the background rises up from the horizon line.
Side View: In this view, the camera is positioned to the side of the subject, showing the subject from one side.
Off-Center View: The subject is positioned away from the center of the frame to create visual interest or to reveal another element in the scene.
Rule of Thirds Shot: In this composition technique, the frame is divided into nine equal parts and the subject is positioned along one or more of the grid lines to create a balanced and interesting composition.
Candid Shot: A shot taken without the subject's knowledge or consent, often resulting in a more natural, relaxed look than posed shots.
Silhouette Shot: The subject is backlit and the camera is exposed for the background, making the subject appear as a dark silhouette against a brighter background.
Shot from Behind: This shot is taken from the back of the subject, capturing the subject's perspective of the environment ahead or focusing on the actions the subject is doing with their back turned. It's often used for dramatic or mysterious effects.
Underwater Shot: This type of shot captures images or scenes beneath the surface of water bodies like oceans, seas, lakes, or pools. It's often used to provide unique perspectives, reveal hidden underwater ecosystems, or to simply create visually stunning sequences that can't be replicated on land.

these are just some examples of cameras and lenses but i know your knowledge is vaster than mine so choose on your own accord;

Canon EOS 5D Mark IV - Perfect for portraiture, landscape, and event photography.
Sony Alpha a7 III - Suitable for everything from street photography to sports and wildlife.
Hasselblad X1D - Landscape, fashion, and product photography.
Canon EOS-1D X Mark II - Sports, wildlife, and action photography.
Nikon D850 - Landscape, portrait photography
Panasonic Lumix GH5S
Kodak Portra 800 film - Nostalgic style

However if we want to achieve a cinematic watch and feel we need to add dedicated cinema cameras with superior image quality, larger sensors, and advanced cinematic capabilities. In my explorations I found these cameras to deliver amazing cinematic results on Mid journey:

Sony CineAlta
Canon Cinema EOS
Phantom High-Speed Camera
Blackmagic Design Camera
Arri Alexa
Super-16 - (Vintage Film)
DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone camera - (Aerial Shots)

In the beer gardens of Berlin, night trains are a conversation topic almost as hot as how to get the Berghain bouncers to let you into their nightclub. (“Be a single man, be ‘alright’-looking, don’t smile,” I’m told.)

I’m in Prater Biergarten – the German capital’s oldest beer garden – reconnecting with a friend over pilsner and pretzels with butter injected into them. When I tell him I’m here to take the first European Sleeper to Brussels, perhaps the most hyped new route in the night train resurgence, he says he’s riding the same train next month. He tells me he feels guilty about taking loads of flights recently, so wants a less climate-crippling option. Plus, he says, “On a night train you can chill and just start drinking.”

Largely due to increased environmental awareness – as well as the reframing of slow overland journeys as enjoyable rather than endurable – this sleeper train revival is chugging healthily. Austria’s Nightjet now serves 25 European cities, and next year France’s Midnight Trains will launch luxury sleepers to 10 destinations.

European Sleeper’s Brussels to Berlin route runs three times a week each way and stops at Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The new line by the Dutch-Belgian startup is the first direct overnight train route between the Belgian and German capitals in more than a decade.

It’s now possible to jump on a two-hour Eurostar from London’s St Pancras station to Brussels-Midi station on a Friday afternoon, then catch the evening European Sleeper from the same Brussels station, and be in Berlin for breakfast. Leaving Berlin on Sunday night, you can again connect with Eurostar in Brussels and arrive in London Monday lunchtime, after a full weekend of Berlin culture\/chaos.

I’m thinking about doing this more. It’s better for the climate and it’s fun. You just get in, sit down, and it’s done

I don't like chicken that isn't processed, and don't like chicken skin. I like pepperoni pizza from Dominoes. I like McDonald's French fries. However, I don't like crispy foods, like crispy pizza, crispy pepperoni, or crispy fries. I like mac&cheese prepared from a box. I like waffles and pancakes. I also eat plain pasta without sauce, as well as plain lentils without sauce. I eat beef burgers with cheese, ketchup, but no onions, no pickles. I don't eat undercooked meat such as medium-well steak. I also like hotdogs made with processed beef weiners and ketchup. I eat fish sticks such as Highliner brand; I don't eat raw fish. I hate onions, garlic, ginger root and other alliums and aromatic vegetables, including powders or flavorings based on them. I don't like saucy foods such as mapo tofu or Chinese braised eggplant. I don't like spices or curries. I don't like smokey flavours like bacon. I don't like fermented or strong flavoured foods like kimchi or natto. I don't like slimey foods such as tofu or mushrooms. I eat processed breakfast cereals such as Cheerios, with and without cold milk. I drink original Pepsi, not diet or otherwise modified. I also drink 1% milk, apple juice, and orange juice without pulp. I drink rum for alcohol. Suggest a variety of 100 different Japanese dishes, meals, foods and drinks I will likely enjoy. Do not include items from restaurants not exclusive to Japan.

Hello all, we will spend 22 days in Japan as first timers in October. I would like to know your comments about our itinerary.

My main concern is if it's realistic to visit everything listed without rushing all the time. I am particularly unsure about visit Ueno Park and Akihabara in the same day as I want to take my time in Akihabara since it's really iconic.

Is it well balanced between the different Tokyo neighborhoods?

Is it worth is to visit Kawaguchiko for that short? I don't want to cut anywhere else so we might skip it if you think it's a bad decision. As a note, we volontarily decided to skip the Takayama Autumn Festival since the accomodations choices were close to none, very expensive or very far.

Also, is buying the JR Rail Pass worth it for this kind of itinerary? It seems that many routes from this itinerary would not be included in the pass.

If there are must sees that I didn't mention, please do tell. Thank you so much to everyone who contributes. :)

Paraphrase the following "Primary (closed-loop) recycling: The primary recycling method is also called closed-loop process or re-extrusion process (Al-Salem et al. 2009). With this method, single-type, non-contaminated plastic wastes whose properties are very similar to pure material are recycled (Singh et al. 2017b). In this method, waste plastics are ground into small pieces, mixed with the original plastic material, and finally processed again (Kumartasli and Avinc 2020). This technique is highly preferred because of its convenience and the quality of the product that is very similar to the original product (Singh et al. 2017b). Plastic bottles produced with a mixture of recycled PET and virgin PET are a good example of primary recycling (Rahimi and Garcia 2017). However, since many plastic materials in the packaging industry are used together with materials such as paper and adhesive, this situation restricts the use of the primary recycling method (Hopewell et al. 2009)."

This image depicts a little girl in a witch’s hat standing in a pumpkin patch surrounded by jack - o - lanterns. She appears to be smiling and happy, as if she is enjoying the fall season. The image is a cartoon style, with rounded shapes and bright colors, making it appear more playful and childish than it would otherwise. The girl’s hair is styled in a curly, purple pigtail, and her dress is a bright red and white striped skirt with a white shirt underneath. The background is a dark, tree lined forest.

The image is not suitable for use in a horror story, as it depicts a happy and carefree little girl in a fun and playful setting. The image may be used in a story that takes place during a festive time of year, such as Halloween, as it conveys a sense of fun and celebration.

SodaStream Art Sparkling Water Maker Bundle (Misty Blue), with CO2, DWS Bottles, and Bubly Drops Flavors
<\/product>


<example1>
This SodaStream replaced our Aarke that broke after 3 years. And, we are super happy with it. Although it doesn’t have the stainless steel wrap, the easy pull down handle is great, and the easy load is top notch! I even allow my kids to use it.
The only issue is that the first pull down ALWAYS spews and overflows water. Not sure why. I’ve made sure I almost just tap it fast enough for a little C02 comes out, but the kids are still having a hard time with the first pull down. We ALWAYS end up with water all over the table and underneath the unit. Not sure if this is a design flaw, or if we just got an extra powerful unit.
<\/example1>


<example2>
I debated on purchasing one of these for a long time.
I did a lot of research before deciding on this one.
I wish I would have purchased it years ago.
It's saved me so much money in just the short time I have had it. Enough to pay for it considering the cost of the the sparkling water I drink.
Very pleased with the Soda stream.
Even my grandson enjoys making the water and adding the flavors.
It's easy to place the co2 cannisters in the machine, and use.
Not sure how long a cannister will last, because I'm still on my first one, and it's been a month and a half since I started using it.
Enjoying the Soda stream.
<\/example2>


<example3>
I purchased this for my house in order to reduce the amount of seltzer water we were buying, and to cut down on the amount of waste material our we generate. The Soda Stream is easy to set up, and easy to use. If you do not want to buy flavor packs, you can make infused water first and then you can carbonate it. You just need to make sure you clean the machine between each use if you do that. I plan on buying this as a gift for my family members and friends. It would absolutely make a great wedding gift or home welcoming gift.
<\/example3>

I recently purchased the SodaStream Art Sparkling Water Maker Bundle in Misty Blue, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. This bundle has everything you need to elevate your hydration game to a whole new level. The Misty Blue color is not only visually appealing but also adds a touch of elegance to my kitchen. The CO2 canister included in the package lasts for a considerable amount of time, allowing me to carbonate water whenever I want without worrying about running out of carbonation. The DWS Bottles are a fantastic addition, ensuring that my sparkling water stays fresh and fizzy for an extended period. What truly sets this bundle apart, though, are the Bubly Drops Flavors. They offer a wide range of delicious flavors that allow me to customize my sparkling water to my liking, from classic cola to exotic tropical flavors. This bundle is not just a water maker; it's a complete sparkling water experience that I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking to enjoy fizzy drinks at home without the hassle of buying bottled beverages.

The SodaStream Art Sparkling Water Maker Bundle has become an essential part of my daily routine. I appreciate the eco-friendly aspect of using this product, as it helps reduce plastic waste from single-use bottles and cans. The ease of operation is impressive – a few quick presses, and I have perfectly carbonated water at my fingertips. The included Bubly Drops Flavors are a game-changer; they add a burst of flavor that transforms ordinary water into a delightful beverage. Plus, the Misty Blue color of the sparkling water maker adds a pop of style to my kitchen counter. Overall, this bundle is a fantastic investment for anyone who enjoys sparkling water and wants the convenience of making it at home, with the added bonus of customizable flavors. I couldn't be more satisfied with my SodaStream Art Sparkling Water Maker Bundle purchase, and I highly recommend it to others looking to enjoy the versatility and convenience it offers.

[CONTEXT]
Thanks for this.  I had a very poor attempt at a launch last year, BUT I did get a lot of the administrative stuff out of the way (incorporation, business bank account, subscriptions to the various services etc.). The store is up, and because I didn't have my workflows dialed in for the limited time I dedicated to this, I felt like the digital art side took too long.  Through Printify though, I noticed that wrapping paper was very easy to generate.  Using your video about repeatable patterns, I used that formula to come up with a bunch of designs.  After a few dozen listings, I sold a whopping 7 items last year.  This wasn't discouraging, but rather a small proof of concept that with more consistency and some very deliberate effort, I can make this work THIS year.

Quickbread muffins are made with flour, sieved together with bicarbonate of soda as a raising agent. To this is added butter, eggs and any flavourings (fruit, such as blueberries, chocolate or banana; or savouries, such as cheese). There are 3 sequential activities: Preparation, Bake, and Packaging. You have 3 resources: you, the oven, and your friend. To produce each batch of muffins, you prepare the material, then put the batch in the oven (there is a single oven which can bake one batch at a time), then your friend takes the batch out and does the packaging. The processing time at each operation is: Preparation 15 minutes, Bake 30 minutes, and Packaging 10 minutes. This system works for 6 hours per day.Compute the daily capacity of the Preparation operation.

try to choose an uncommon and original camera angle, pick from this list:

Extreme Long Shot: This shot is taken from a great distance, with the subject often hardly visible. The main purpose is to highlight the subject's surroundings, providing a sense of scale and geographical location.
Long Shot (also known as Wide Shot): This shot shows the entire subject along with its environment. For a person, a long shot would typically include the full body, providing context and a sense of scale.
Medium Shot: This shot typically frames the subject from the waist up or chest up. It's often used in dialogue scenes in movies to show a subject along with some context of their surroundings.
Closeup Shot: The subject takes up the full frame in this shot, usually focusing on the face for a person. This shot type emphasizes details and expressions, intensifying the emotions portrayed by the subject.
Extreme Closeup Shot: This shot typically features a part of a person or an object, such as a person's eye or a detail on an item. It brings attention to a specific feature or detail, emphasizing its significance.
Full Shot: This shot typically frames the subject fully from head to toe, capturing the entire body within the scene. It's often used to showcase the character's physicality or actions within the environment.
Two-Shot: A shot that includes two subjects, often used in conversation scenes. This shot helps establish the relationship between the characters and can show their reactions to each other.
Over-the-Shoulder Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a person standing behind a subject, with the person in the foreground's shoulder and back of the head included in the shot. It's often used in dialogue scenes to create a sense of depth and connection between the characters.
Point of View Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a subject, showing what the subject would see. It helps the audience identify with the character's perspective and experience the scene from the character's viewpoint.
Establishing Shot: This shot is typically an extreme long shot at the beginning of a scene, indicating where, and sometimes when, the remainder of the scene takes place. It sets the context for the audience by showing the setting and characters.
Master Shot: A master shot includes all the key figures in a scene and all the action happening in it. It's often the first shot of a scene, used to provide the viewer with the layout and dynamics of the scene's environment.
Low Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from below, making it appear larger, more dominant or powerful.
High Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from above, making it appear smaller or less significant.
Eye Level Shot: A neutral camera angle that is approximately at the subject's eye level, creating a natural perspective.
Dutch Angle Shot: A camera angle in which the camera is intentionally tilted to one side, creating a sense of disorientation or unease.
Overhead Shot: A camera angle that looks directly down on the subject from above, providing a unique perspective and context.
Bird's Eye View Shot: A higher vantage point than an overhead shot, as if the viewer were looking down from the sky or a very high altitude. It provides a wider perspective and can capture an entire scene or landscape, offering a sense of scale and context.
Drone Shot: An aerial camera angle using a drone that often provides higher perspectives than traditional bird's-eye views and overhead views.
Worm's-eye view: A camera angle that looks up at the subject from ground level, creating a dramatic and unusual perspective often used to make the subject appear formidable or threatening.
Ground-level view: In a ground-level view, the camera is placed at ground level. This can make for dramatic shots where the background rises up from the horizon line.
Side View: In this view, the camera is positioned to the side of the subject, showing the subject from one side.
Off-Center View: The subject is positioned away from the center of the frame to create visual interest or to reveal another element in the scene.
Rule of Thirds Shot: In this composition technique, the frame is divided into nine equal parts and the subject is positioned along one or more of the grid lines to create a balanced and interesting composition.
Candid Shot: A shot taken without the subject's knowledge or consent, often resulting in a more natural, relaxed look than posed shots.
Silhouette Shot: The subject is backlit and the camera is exposed for the background, making the subject appear as a dark silhouette against a brighter background.
Shot from Behind: This shot is taken from the back of the subject, capturing the subject's perspective of the environment ahead or focusing on the actions the subject is doing with their back turned. It's often used for dramatic or mysterious effects.
Underwater Shot: This type of shot captures images or scenes beneath the surface of water bodies like oceans, seas, lakes, or pools. It's often used to provide unique perspectives, reveal hidden underwater ecosystems, or to simply create visually stunning sequences that can't be replicated on land.
