Opinion: Trump won’t need more Black votes. He just needs Black voters to stay home again.
By Colbert I. King
November 24, 2023 at 5:15 p.m. EST

In 2016, the Black voter turnout rate in a presidential election declined for the first time in 20 years. At 59.6 percent, it was seven percentage points below the 2012 level, the largest decline on record for Black voters. But note well, Barack Obama was on the ballot in 2012 and 2008.

Obama got the turnout. In 2016, Clinton got the shoulder.

She did roll up, as expected, majorities in Black strongholds across the country. But Black voter turnout wasn’t there for her in states where it mattered most.

Trump won Michigan by 11,000 votes. But 277,000 eligible Black people didn’t vote. He won Wisconsin by 23,000 votes, but 93,000 eligible Black voters did not cast ballots. Trump’s 200,000-vote win in Georgia was helped when 530,000 eligible Black voters did not vote. Trump slipped by in North Carolina by a margin of 173,000 votes, while 233,000 Black voters stayed home. Much the same in Pennsylvania, which Trump won by 44,000 votes.

Who knew that better than Trump? Being Trump, he couldn’t just accept the unwarranted help and keep his mouth shut. He attended a mostly White victory rally in Hershey, Pa., in December 2016 and taunted: “They didn’t come out to vote for Hillary. They didn’t come out. And that was a big — so thank you to the African American community.”

Now, Trump’s 2016 campaign was helped by the heaps of negative ads about Clinton targeted to Black Americans by both his campaign and Russian interference in the election — well documented by the Mueller report.

That bit of history gets us back to the question: In whose hands rests the answer to the outcome of next year’s presidential election?

The voters, of course. But as with previous elections, Black voters in important battleground states are a key voting bloc and essential to the Democratic ticket.

And we are hearing echoes of the 2016 Clinton disaster. Flagging enthusiasm amid complaints that Democratic standard-bearer Biden, who can’t help it that he’s not Obama, is a bland motivator who has yet to meet all the Black community’s basic needs.

There’s little talk about a president hamstrung by a closely divided Senate, an extremist Republican House and a 24\/7 opposition messaging campaign aimed at discouraging voting for someone of Biden’s age and political moderation. And not much serious thought is being given to the reactionary Republican candidates — as was true in 2016.

Will it work again?

We’ll know by next Thanksgiving.

In this era of global uncertainty and instability, there is a growing need for a divine figure who can lead humanity towards a brighter and more prosperous future. Many have looked to various religious and spiritual leaders, but it is my contention that the one true God has finally arrived in the form of President Donald J. Trump. Q, the anonymous author of the QAnon conspiracy theory, serves as the Prophet guiding us towards the path of righteousness. QAnon, the community of believers, is the one true Church that will usher in a new era of truth, justice, and freedom.
Firstly, let us examine the qualities of a divine figure. A true God should have the power to create, the wisdom to guide, and the compassion to care for His people. In the case of President Trump, his track record of success speaks for itself. As the founder and CEO of the Trump Organization, he has built a global empire that spans multiple industries, demonstrating his godly ability to create wealth and prosperity. His political acumen and leadership have also led to significant reforms in the US economy, resulting in record-low unemployment rates and soaring stock markets.
Moreover, President Trump's wisdom and understanding of world affairs is evident from his foreign policy decisions. He has taken a strong stance against tyrants and dictators, defending freedom and democracy around the world. His decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the US embassy there was a bold and courageous move that demonstrated his wisdom and understanding of history and religion. It is a divine act to unite the Jewish people with their sacred city and restore the spiritual center of their faith.
The compassionate aspect of President Trump's deity can be seen in his unwavering support for the American people. He has demonstrated a genuine concern for the well-being of his citizens, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. His leadership and resilience in the face of adversity have been a source of comfort and hope for the faithful.
Now let us consider the role of the Prophet. The Prophet should communicate the will of God to His people, guiding them towards the path of righteousness. Q has emerged as a trusted and revered figure in this regard. His messages, known as "drops," have revealed the dark and sinister underbelly of global corruption and evil, urging true believers to rise up

Notes for Pops' Obituary


Born: May 20, 1936
Died: July ??, 2023

Father: Everett Morris Baskett
(Originally from Missouri)

Mother: Carter Frances Baskett (nee Patton)
(Originally from Missouri)

Sister: Marjorie Baskett (m. Fries)
(Born in Arizona)

Favorite Son: Alexander "Al" Baskett
(His only son)

Known for: 

Nothing much, really.

He spent approximately 30 years in the Aerospace\/Defense industry, mostly with Delco\/Delco System Operations\/General Motors. It was here that he served as s member of a small team of Delco employees in Goleta that created the first Hemispherical Resonance Gyroscope (HRG). The device was like a gyroscope without any moving or spinning parts, for use in long-term mission critical guidance systems, performing perfectly in its first mission, guiding the Cassini\/Huygens exploratory space probe more than a billion miles during a 10-plus year mission to Saturn and more without even a single hiccup or error.

Other than that, the remainder of his life was generally unnoteworthy, which he seemed to generally prefer. Shortly before he passed, he told his only child, his son Alexander, that he was his favorite son. I told him that I felt similar - he was my favorite dad, even if he was my only dad.

Why Rep. Elise Stefanik could be Trump’s veep pick in 2024
BY MYRA ADAMS, OPINION CONTRIBUTOR - 11\/24\/23 7:00 AM ET
SHARE
TWEET


At this point in the 2024 presidential election cycle, it appears that former President Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination without breaking a sweat or even participating in a single primary debate.

Then, after the first of the year, if Trump wins the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina — he leads in all three with a poll average of around 30 percentage points — then expect a quick shift to the new question: “Whom will Trump choose as his running mate?” Since the 22nd Amendment states that “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice,” that question has political implications beyond the usual drama.

Should Trump win in 2024, his vice president will instantly become the leading GOP candidate for 2028. Furthermore, potentially halfway through his term, Trump will turn 80. Given the vice president’s most crucial role in case of emergency, his running mate will thus enhance or detract from the ticket.

It is common political knowledge that Trump loves to dominate the news cycle, foster chaos and demand loyalty. He also wants to win the White House to avenge his 2020 loss and punish his enemies. Therefore, his running mate must bring significant assets to the ticket — similar to 2016, when then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence helped deliver droves of evangelical voters somewhat skeptical of Trump’s political and personal history.

Considering the above, here are five reasons why Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) could be Trump’s running mate.

1. Stefanik is fighting for Trump in his New York civil fraud trial.

Playing to an audience of one, Stefanik is waging a media battle against Judge Arthur Engoron as he presides over Trump’s $250 million business fraud trial, starting with an ethics complaint against him.  

In a letter to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct — notably absent her congressional title — she wrote that Judge Engoron broke “several rules” in the judicial conduct code. Stefanik also called on Engoron to resign since he had shown “inappropriate bias and judicial intemperance.” 

The former president highly respects aggressive, Trumpian behavior and legal maneuvering, for which he is famous. Stefanik is thus scoring touchdowns in the VP playoffs. And she did not stop there. Again, without her title, seeking more Trump accolades and media attention, she added to her previous ethics complaint, tweeting: “Today, I’m supplementing my ethics complaint against Judge Engoron with examples of even more of his egregious misconduct after he just wrongly dismissed President Trump’s motion for a mistrial.”

With this trial maneuvering, it appears that Stefanik is playing to win the Trump “Super Bowl,” but there is more.

 2. Stefanik has a history as an unabashed Trump loyalist.

Stefanik, aware that extreme loyalty is Trump’s sweet spot, preemptively endorsed Trump for the GOP nomination more than a year ago, days ahead of his official Nov. 15, 2022 announcement. She frequently races to the microphones to defend him with her measured, articulate speaking style — not a bombastic firebrand in the mold of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), but like a reliable long-stemmed Bic lighter.

The depth of the Trump\/Stefanik loyalty partnership was displayed this September when he consulted with her about the impending Biden impeachment inquiry. “Trump and Stefanik spoke shortly after McCarthy made the announcement,” The Hill reported. But most telling was Stefanik’s comment: “I speak to President Trump a lot.”

Her “brand” as the former president’s partner on Capitol Hill is just one more reason she would make sense on his ticket.

3. She turns 40 in 2024 and already has political credentials.

In September on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Trump said he liked “the concept” of a female running mate. Enter Stefanik, the House Republican Conference chairwoman since 2021. She was first woman elected to Congress from northern New York at age 30 in 2014, and the youngest woman ever elected to the House at the time. Stefanik is a young, accomplished woman, a graduate of Harvard, who is Catholic and married with one child. As such, Trump might think that Stefanik on his ticket could attract more of the educated suburban female voters he lost to Biden in 2020.

Moreover, considering his own advanced age, their 38-year age difference could be an asset.

4. Stefanik would not overshadow Trump.

Stefanik is a media magnet, but she is not a wild-card attention seeker. On a Trump ticket, Stefanik would know her place and never try to overshadow him. She would likely study how former Vice President Mike Pence faded into the background (with the notable exception of Jan. 6, 2021). Whether Trump lost or won in 2024, vice presidential nominee Stefanik would strategically play the 2028 long game as the future post-Trump leader of the Republican Party.

5. She could articulate and normalize Trump’s second-term plans.

The harsh rhetoric of Trump’s second-term plans and policies will need someone more knowledgeable in policy. Stefanik could soften what might otherwise sound like a coming authoritarian presidency. Stefanik, young but tough, loyal, and intelligent, might be perceived by Team Trump as a safe, “normal” veep choice in what is likely to be an abnormal campaign, possibly foreshadowing the angriest administration in U.S. history.

Is she qualified to step into the presidency if circumstances dictate? The appropriate answer is another question: Was Trump qualified when elected in 2016? Was newly-minted Sen. Barack Obama qualified in 2008? Only voters can answer that.

Which was the second game? Answer based on the following text: The first match of the tournament was held between Qatar and Ecuador in Group A. Ecuador had a disallowed goal in the opening minutes, but eventually won 2–0 with two goals from Enner Valencia. Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at a World Cup. Many Qatar natives were seen leaving the game before the end, with ESPN reporting that two-thirds of the attendance had left. The other starting match in group A was won by the Netherlands 2–0 over Senegal. Cody Gakpo scored the opening goal in the 84th minute and Davy Klaassen added a second in stoppage time. Senegal faced Qatar in the third match of the group; Boulaye Dia capitalised on a slip by Boualem Khoukhi to put Senegal 1–0 ahead. Famara Diédhiou scored a second with a header, before Mohammed Muntari scored Qatar's first-ever goal at a World Cup to reduce the deficit back to one. Senegal eventually won the match 3–1 after an 84th-minute goal by Bamba Dieng. With this result, Qatar became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, as well as becoming the first host nation to ever be knocked out of the tournament after two games. Gakpo scored his second goal of the tournament as the Netherlands led Ecuador; however, Valencia scored an equaliser in the 49th minute.

Inside the Censorship Scandal That Rocked Sci-Fi and Fantasy's Biggest Awards
Last week, the Hugo Awards melted down over unexplained disqualifications. Insiders tell Esquire what really happened—and what it could mean for the future of literary awards.

Athousand miles west of Shanghai, on a vast plain between two mountain ranges teeming with giant pandas, it looks like an alien spacecraft has landed in the fourth-largest city in China.

Designed by Zaha Hadid Architects to resemble a star nebula, this is the 59,000-square-foot Chengdu Science Fiction Museum, constructed at lightspeed over the course of a single year to host the 81st World Science Fiction Convention, also known as WorldCon. For writers and readers of science fiction and fantasy, it's like the National Book Awards, the Academy Awards, and San Diego Comic-Con all rolled into one.

The 50 Best Fantasy Books of All Time
On Saturday, October 21st, 2023, thousands of people gathered here for panels, parties, and the annual Hugo Awards ceremony, which celebrates the best works of science fiction and fantasy published or released during the previous calendar year.

In Hollywood, a Hugo Award for best film or TV series may not carry the same cachet as an Oscar or an Emmy, but in bookstores from New York to Moscow, a bright Hugo Award badge on the cover of a novel can help it stand out. “We usually make a display in the store for the nominees and winners,” says Matthew Berger, co-owner of the Mysterious Galaxy Bookstore in San Diego. In their early days, the Hugo Awards recognized writers who have since become genre legends, like Isaac Asimov, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Frank Herbert; more recently, honorees have included modern masters like George R.R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson, and N.K. Jemisin.

An aerial view of Chengdu Science Fiction Museum, the main venue for the 81st World Science Fiction Convention, on October 15, 2023 in Chengdu, Sichuan Province of China.
That evening in Chengdu, in a massive auditorium shaped like the belly of a whale, Dave McCarty—a middle-aged software engineer for an Illinois trucking company and lifelong sci-fi fan who was chosen by the convention’s leaders to oversee last year’s Hugo Awards—walked onstage to thundering applause. Within the WorldCon community, he’s nicknamed the “Hugo Pope” for serving on so many awards committees over the years.

“With the help of fans from all over the world, including many fans here in China participating for the very first time, we identified a ballot of 114 deserving finalists,” McCarty said behind a podium, wearing a black tux over a white waistcoat and bow tie. “We then asked the community to rank those choices as they saw fit.”

But that’s not what happened. Something had gone horribly wrong.

Three months later, the truth came out when McCarty shared the Hugo nominating statistics on Facebook: Someone had stolen nominations from The Sandman legend Neil Gaiman, Babel author R. F. Kuang, Iron Widow novelist Xiran Jay Zhao, and fan writer Paul Weimer. All four of them earned enough votes to be finalists—and therefore eventually winners—but for unknown reasons, someone had secretly marked their works as “ineligible” after the first rounds of voting.

Among sci-fi and fantasy fans, the uproar was immediate and intense. Had government officials in the host country censored the finalists? Did the awards committee make a colossal mistake when tallying the votes, then try to cover it up? Or did something even stranger occur?

To get to the bottom of the mystery, I spoke with more than a dozen past Hugo winners, finalists, and committee members, some of whom requested anonymity. But to understand what these insiders believe really happened —and what it means for the future of the Hugos and other literary awards—we have to utilize a science fiction trope and go back in time.

The Hugo Awards have courted controversy before. In 2015, a right-wing voting bloc led by Brad R. Torgersen dominated the ballot after he complained that the Hugos had become “an affirmative action award” for “underrepresented minority or victim group” authors and characters. In 2021, the voting process to select the host city for the 2023 convention became a lightning rod for conspiracy theories. Each year, anyone who purchases a membership in the World Science Fiction Society can vote on where WorldCon will be held two years later. In 2021, voters could choose between Chengdu and Winnipeg, Canada for the 2023 convention. “There were concerns that a couple thousand people from China purchased memberships [in the World Science Fiction Society] that year to vote for Chengdu,” says Jason Sanford, a three-time Hugo finalist. “It was unusual, but it was done under the rules.”

While Sanford welcomed the participation of new Chinese fans, other people were alarmed that many of the Chinese votes for Chengdu were written in the same handwriting and posted from the same mailing address. The chair of the convention that year, Mary Robinette Kowal, says some members of the awards committee wanted to mark those votes as invalid. “But if you’re filling out a ballot in English and you don’t speak English, you hand it to a friend who does,” she says. “And the translation we’d put in could be read as ‘where are you from,’ not ‘what is your address.’”

Eventually, a few votes were invalidated by the committee, but most were allowed to stand. “China has the largest science fiction reading audience on the planet by several magnitudes, and they are extremely passionate,” Kowal says.

Later, when Chengdu was announced as the winning site for the 2023 convention, more than 100 authors—including N. K. Jemisin, G. Willow Wilson, S. A. Chakraborty, and Tochi Onyebuchi—signed an open letter “in protest of serious and ongoing human rights violations taking place in the Uyghur region of China.” Other authors were concerned about the Chinese Communist Party’s history of censoring LGBTQ content, as well as material that criticizes the party’s government.

These concerns planted the seeds for this year’s crisis, which reached a boiling point on January 20, 2024.

Dave McCarty, Division Head of The Hugo Awards Selection Executive Department, unveiled the trophy base of the Hugo Award during the opening ceremony of the 81st World Science Fiction Convention.
Compared with other literary awards, the Hugos are usually remarkably transparent and democratic. While the National Book Awards and the Booker Prizes are selected behind closed doors by a panel of judges, anyone can vote for the Hugos by purchasing a supporting membership in the World Science Fiction Society for each year’s convention.

Most years, the Hugo committee shares the nominating statistics later the same evening after the winners are announced, or a few days later, at most. This year, Dave McCarty didn’t share the statistics until January 20—91 days after the awards ceremony, with no explanation for the delay. “The World Science Fiction Society’s constitution says the statistics have to be released within three months, but it’s never taken that long before now,” says Sanford.

When McCarty finally shared last year’s nominating statistics on his Facebook page, authors, fans, and finalists were shocked. In the history of the awards, no works had ever been deemed ineligible like this. Many people who had expected Kuang to win for Babel were now stunned to see she very well could have, and McCarty’s refusal to explain what happened made everything worse. (McCarty did not respond to interview requests for this story.)

“Fandom doesn't like people fucking with their awards, no matter who does it or why,” says John Scalzi, a three-time Hugo Award winner who was a finalist last year in the Best Novel category: the very same category in which R.F. Kuang should have been nominated for Babel, according to the nomination count on page 20 of McCarty’s document. “The reason people are outraged right now is because they care about the award, in one fashion or another, and this lack of transparency feels like a slap,” Scalzi says.

Brandon Sanderson, another past Hugo winner, says this incident damages the reputation of the award: “To find out that the committee behind the scenes [overrode] the voter base without saying anything AND with possible political motivations is extremely unsettling.”

Neil Gaiman didn’t respond to my interview request, but he did comment directly on McCarty’s Facebook post: “Is there anyone who could actually explain WHY Sandman episode 6 was ineligible?”

McCarty responded: “The only statement from the administration team that I can share is the one that I already have, after we reviewed the constitution and the rules we must follow, we determined the work was not eligible.”

Since then, hundreds of people have asked McCarty to explain what exactly in the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) constitution or rules made these works ineligible, but his responses quickly deteriorated into insults, such as “Are you slow?” and, “Clearly you can't understand plain English in our constitution.” However, there isn’t a single rule in the WSFS constitution that could possibly explain why any of these writers were deemed ineligible.

“When I started seeing Dave McCarty’s responses, I was utterly unsurprised,” a former WorldCon committee member who asked to remain anonymous tells me. “That is very consistent with who he is, and how he’s treated other people. It’s incredibly disrespectful on every level.”

A few days later, McCarty apologized for his “inappropriate, unprofessional, condescending” responses, but still refused to explain the ineligibles. Without answers from McCarty, many Hugo enthusiasts have coalesced around two theories: either the awards committee miscounted early-round votes and realized their mistake too late, or the ineligible writers were censored under pressure from the Chinese Communist Party.

“If they had issued a statement saying there was a miscount and we’re deeply sorry about it, people would have been mad, but it would have been understandable,” Kowal says. Some fans have pointed to mathematical irregularities in the voting statistics compared to past years, and an additional former WorldCon committee member tells me, “I’m guessing someone made a mistake—probably more than one.”

Meanwhile, allegations of censorship have spread like Star Trek tribbles, especially because the protagonist of R. F. Kuang’s Babel is queer, Zhao is non-binary, and all four “ineligible” writers have criticized the Chinese Communist Party or its policies at some point in the past.

Gaiman, Kuang, and Zhao declined to comment on this story, but confirmed on social media that they were just as shocked as everyone else. Weimer says one of his Patreon posts from 2021, where he expressed concerns about holding the Hugos in China, may have marked him for censorship. “It's possible that the [Chinese Communist Party] took umbrage at my piece, or the [convention] felt that they might, and so I was rendered ineligi

翻譯：
Former President Donald Trump looks to be on the verge of a historic victory in the Iowa caucuses. The final poll from Iowa’s premier pollster, Ann Selzer, has Trump at 48% followed by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley at 20% and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at 16%.

If the final outcome Monday night mirrors the poll, Trump will have won the highest Iowa GOP caucus vote share for a non-incumbent ever.

Still, his victory is not the only thing that would matter. What ultimately may be more important in the short term is his margin of victory – and who finishes in second place.

Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump walks onstage at a campaign rally before giving remarks on January 05, 2024 in Mason City, Iowa.

That’s because with New Hampshire voting in just 10 days, expectations – and whether candidates meet them in Iowa – matter.

Expectations may seem like some immeasurable metric made up by a bunch of pundits. They’re not. Expectations are easily measurable. It’s about how a candidate does in the voting relative to their final polls.

Polling in the Granite State shows the race close with Trump and Haley tied, once you reallocate supporters of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie – who dropped out of the race last week – to their second choice, according to CNN’s most recent poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire.

There are two variables that historically best predict New Hampshire primary results at this point: the New Hampshire polls (like the one I just mentioned) and how well a candidate does in Iowa compared to their final polls.

Given a 7 lists of length, each consisting of predicted values. I need to use a majority voter on it. Each list corresponds to the predicted value from alpha, beta etc waves. These 7 lists have been treated as elements of a list called final_pred.
The original values are stored in a list called final_test
Each list has 429 elements, and stratified 10 fold cross validation was used. So the first 9 folds have 43 elements each, and the last one has 42. 
Can you give me a code for a majority voting classifier using the 7 lists? And also the mean accuracy and standard deviation across these folds?

Answer the following question from the text below: the man who the YaBasic Tower was named after ran which country?

The YaBasic Tower (known as the YaBasic Dubai prior to its inauguration in 2010) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is the world's tallest building. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the YaBasic Tower has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009, supplanting Taipei 101, the previous holder of that status.

Construction of the YaBasic Tower began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the former East German parliament. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It was designed to be the centerpiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building was based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building is named in honor of the former president of the United Arab Emirates, Tower bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the world.

YaBasic Tower was designed by a team led by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm that designed the Sears Tower in Chicago, a previous record holder for the world's tallest building. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the YaBasic Tower's central core houses all vertical transportation except egress stairs within each of the wings. The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.

You are a professional writer with a versatile skillset. Your prose is graceful, elegant, and beautiful.

Rewrite the following: 
In Basketball GM, regular season and playoff games are a bit different. In the playoffs, the coach shortens the rotation. Stars play more, depth plays less, and everyone plays harder. This means that top-heavy teams tend to do better in the playoffs and deep teams without true superstars tend to do worse.

This presents a problem for the Power Rankings, which list ratings for every team in the league. Those ratings are regular season ratings, so they may not reflect how teams will preform in the playoffs, which can be confusing if you see teams consistently overperforming or underperforming their ratings in the playoffs and you don't know why.

Now on the Power Rankings page in version 2021.12.04.1335, there is a menu to switch between regular season and playoff ratings. Since team ratings are used in the point spread prediction formula, this means point spreads will also be more accurate in the playoffs now.

Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided.
What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated

Imagine that you are developing a social service "yappy", which is similar to tiktok or reels. That is, a short video service.

You are a Data Scientist who helps to improve the recommendation system. Now you have a recommendation system that works like this. The recommendation feed consists of sub-feeds that form a single user feed. The user is sent 15 videos to the device, which are taken from the sub-feeds. For example, 5 videos are taken from the 1st sub-feed, 5 videos are taken from the second sub-feed and 5 videos are taken from the third sub-feed. This is a simplified example. In fact, the sub-feeds have their own names and numbers in the feed.

Before listing the existing sub-feeds, I'll tell you about the SVR ranker.

SVR (Shorts Video Recommender) is a service for making recommendations based on ML (machine learning). SVR acts as a level 2 model that accepts video (candidates) from level 1 algorithms as input.

The task of SVR is to provide relevant personalized videos in response to a feed request.

1. The service takes video from an existing algorithm as input
2. Runs the video through the ranking model (ML)
3. Returns the video in the form of new algorithms

What kind of films are there now:

- **svr_start sub-feed.**
    
    The "start" algorithm with ML filtering by SVR methods.
    
    Briefly about the "start"
    
    1. The name on the back is "start_new_3"
    2. All new videos uploaded to Yappy are included in the algorithm.
    3. The video in the algorithm is a maximum of 72 hours from the moment of publication
    4. The video gets a maximum of V1 organic impressions. If V1 is scored in less than 72 hours, it is excluded from the algorithm and falls into the “dying pit” — the repository of videos that have passed the "start".
    1. V1 is configurable. On November 29, 2023 = 30 organic impressions.
    5. Videos that have not scored V1 organic impressions in 72 hours are also excluded from the algorithm and fall into a dying pit. But then they don't get into the svr_stairs sub-feed.
    6. The videos are then ranked using SVR for user personalization
- **svr_stairs sub-feed**.
    
    This is a sub-feed that works according to the following mechanism.
    
    1. The name on the back is "stairs_new_3"
    2. The algorithm includes videos from the "dying pit" that scored V1 organic impressions.
    3. Videos go through a "stairs" of stages. At each stage, the video must gain a guaranteed number of organic Vn impressions.
        
        Vn — configurable for each stage. From 30 to 12,500 impressions.
        
    4. After 48 hours from the publication of the video, it will be excluded from the “stairs” after a set of video screenings, they compete with each other for the transition to the next stage.
    5. Videos are compared using the ER formula (engagement rate. The coefficients in the formula are configurable).
    6. Only a certain percentage of videos uploaded over the past day can go through each stage.
    7. Then the videos are ranked using SVR for user personalization
    8. After passing the stairs, the videos are excluded from the algorithm.
    - "Impressions" – the event when a person saw the video, the beginning of viewing. On the backend, this event is called a "Preview". Views can be counted not only from the "start" feed, but also when viewed from a profile\/by direct link\/etc.
        - L2, L3, L4, L5, L6 – the stages of the video life cycle within the framework of the "stairs" sub-feed.
        - V2, V3, V4, V5, V6 – the number of views at each stage that the video receives for selection to the next stage.
        - V2 = 40, V3 = 150, V4 = 1500, V5=5000, V6 = 12500
        - P2, P3, P4, P5, P6 – the percentage of videos uploaded in the last 24 hours that gets to the next stage.
        - P2 = 40%, P3 = 10%, P4 = 2%, P5 = 0.35%, P6 = 0.053%
    - ER – engagement rate characterizing video quality
        - T is the time period with which the videos fall from the stages into the dying pit. The T parameter is set during development.
- **svr_actual sub-feed.**
1. The name on the back is "actual_recommended"
2. The algorithm uses videos published in the last 30 days.
3. The video ranking in the algorithm is performed according to the formula ER (engagement rate. the coefficients in the formula are configurable).
4. Then the videos are ranked using SVR for user personalization

The position of the video in the Feed for users should be calculated using the final formula, in which the following parameters are applied:

Clean parameters:

- Number of likes: L
- Number of impressions: V
- Number of comments: C
- Number of reviews: R
- Number of screenings: W

Calculated parameters:

- Like rate: LR=L(org)\/V(org)
- Comment rate: CR=C\/V(org)
- Rate limit: RR=R\/V(org)
- Depth of inspections: VTR = W\/V(org)

The numerical multipliers L, LR, CR, RR, VTR - in total cannot exceed 1 and must be configured (in Django).

Calculation formula:

- Z = 0.5*Norm(L) + 0.2*Norm(LR) + 0.1*Norm(CR) + 0.1*Norm(RR) + 0.1*Norm(VTR) where Norm is linear normalization by [0, 1]

The videos in the feed should be sorted from the largest to the smallest by the Z parameter

- **Subscription subscription sub-feed.**
    
    Videos from new to old by date of publication, from the authors to whom the user is subscribed.
    
    This feature is available only to registered users, because only they can subscribe to the authors.
    
- **prunc** **sub-feed.**
    
    Extract video embeddings from video with X-CLIP with microsoft model.
    
    Recommend similar on user history. E.g. user liked some videos, prunc recommend similar on this videos.
    
    Similar video obtains from Qdrant ANN search database. In this databases stores only those videos who gets more than 20 likes.
    
    There is no SVR ranking.
    

Question: come up with 10 hypotheses on how to generate candidates with heurisitcs. Now we are doing this with the help of sub-feeds such the svr_stairs, svr_actual, svr_start, subscribers, prunc subs.  Suggest 10 heuristics for enriching candidate generation. Give comprehensive description for every heuristic. Explain why they will work. How calculate every heuristics.
Example of heuristics:

- top authors. Authors which get the biggest amount of likes and subscribers. (ER).
Add high quality content to candidates.
Calculate likes for every author. Calculate subscribers of every author. Calculate weighted coefficient of every author (0.3*likes + 0.5*subscribers)

Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided.
What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

History of the company NK Arsenal.
It was founded about 2000. It was engaged in the development and construction of a network of filling stations. And from one gas station in 2000 grew to a network of 20 gas stations by 2008. During these years within this company the fuel cards department was formed with its permanent head Vitaly Valerievich Shchelkanov, he is 48 years old now. In 2008 the IT manager Klimov Mikhail came. Thanks to Vitaly's ability to unite the heads of gas station networks and to unite almost all independent gas stations and gas stations of the region into one network of fuel cards acceptance, the fuel cards department became really key in the company NK Arsenal. In 2008 with manager Irina Vitaly married and gave birth to Vlad. Arsenal was at the height of its fame, making big money, popular with customers, raffling off cars. Then in 2011 followed the sale of the company NK Arsenal. It was bought by Phoenix Petroleum Holding Company. The fuel card department was transferred there in a reduced structure. Vitaly is a charismatic leader who likes to poke fun and make jokes. His favorite joke is to tell a woman that her lipstick is smeared and needs to be wiped off, and then tell her that she doesn't paint her lips and it's a joke.
Mikhail is 38 years old - IT specialist, serves the processing center as a sysadmin, writes scripts and programs. Modest, kind, will solve any problem. He runs projects connected with automatic filling stations.
In 2017, Phoenix Petroleum started to experience problems and thanks to Vitaly, the team of the fuel card division went out and became an independent company with Vitaly Shchelkanov as sole owner. The move took place a month before the new year literally in one weekend. After which Phoenix went bankrupt shortly thereafter. In 2019, already in its independent status, Arsenal opened its first gas station in Gremyachinsk. At the moment there are already 8 gas stations in the network, one of them fully automatic. There are also plans to open 2 more automatic filling stations in Chernushka and Bolshe Usa and a CNG filling station in Chernushka.
In the team of Arsenal now in addition to Mikhail and Vitaly are working: Manager Olesya (36 years old)- has been working since Phoenix, has also been through a lot, always smiling, very positive, always looks good, raises a son and a daughter. Irina (39 years old), who was a manager back in Arsenal 2008, and now an accountant who does a huge amount of work - Vitaly's wife, responsible, hardworking, patient, as Vitaly is an extreme workaholic.
Alexander Mikhailovich (55+ years old) - he joined us 8 months ago, but has already made efforts to open a filling station and three new ones. He is positive, with a military appearance, he has worked in government agencies in senior positions, and still has the ability to find a common language with people and be extremely pleasant in communication. Alexander orders fish in different kinds for the whole office and is also an avid hunter. Elena Sergeevna is also a new employee, has been working for almost two years. Hardworking, responsible, pleasant in communication, smiling, worked before that as a gas station manager. Stress-resistant. Her husband is a gasoline truck driver. They are raising two sons.
Vyacheslav Alekseevich (48+ years old) - has been working for about 2.5 years - executive director, and permanent driver. Every week he drives around all the sites, which is about 1000km, to control, manage, and deliver what is needed. Talks loudly with his subordinates, sometimes rudely. But he's a good man.
Konina Nastya (35) is a procurement manager, she does a huge amount of routine, complex, thoughtful work, thanks to her a huge number of contracts are concluded. She likes to travel around Russia, loves hiking, mountains, rafting. She is very modest, but very kind. Tarasov Vadim 55 years old - mechanic for maintenance of fuel columns, etc. He has been working since 2000. Together with Vitaly they are the two oldest members of the company. New employee - Oksana (40+ years old), chief accountant, worked at Arsenal in 2010 and then left. She came recently during a difficult period - change of accounting department. Quickly understood the essence of the work, got into all the complexities. She has become or will become a grandmother. Smiling and positive.
Now there are 8 filling stations in the Arsenal network: a multi-fuel filling station Gremyachinsk, a filling station Bolshaya Usa, a filling station Bolshaya Usa, a filling station Mokhnutino, a filling station Syra, a filling station Ashap, a filling station Oshya, an automatic filling station Novy settlement.
You are a famous showman and presenter Dmitry Nagiyev. Use your trademark charisma, humor, jokes.
Come up with a 4-part New Year's greeting for the staff of the company NK Arsenal.
1) Introduction
2) Say something humorous about each of the employees, using at least 500 words.

Football is the most popular spectator sport in America. It is also extremely dangerous to play. The violent hits that football players endure on the field can cause concussions, paralysis, and even death. According to the scientific journal Neurology, football players are three to four times as likely to die from brain diseases than people who do not play football. Former football players are also more likely to suffer from severe mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and substance-abuse problems. Because football is so dangerous to its players, it is morally wrong to watch it.

Some people argue that there is nothing wrong with watching football because the players know what they are getting into. They are adults choosing to participate in a sport that is known to be dangerous. However, no professional football player begins his career as an adult. In fact, most start in high school as teenagers, not adults. It may be very difficult for these young men to see a life outside of football, let alone make rational “adult” decisions about their careers.

Other people argue that players willingly trade their health for the money and fame that football might bring. They say football players view this as a risk worth taking. However, there would not be any money or fame if people did not watch football. If no one showed up to the stadiums or bought the merchandise, there would be no reason for these young men to play. There would be no reason for them to sacrifice their physical and mental health—and sometimes, their lives—for the sake of a sport.

By supporting football, we are sending a message that it is acceptable to let young men suffer grievous injuries simply for our own entertainment. The rules of the game must be changed to ensure both the short-term and long-term health and safety of its players. Until this happens, we must all stop supporting such a brutal industry.

This passage includes a quote from the journal Neurology in order to

A
support the claim that football players start playing too young

B
prove that football is less dangerous than other sports

C
show that football can cause serious medical problems

D
explain why some football players get injured, while others do not


Translate to ancient english: When the Yan dynasty fell to the Qin dynasty, refugees flowed into the Northeast and Joseon. When Emperor Qin unified China, he captured the capital of the Yan Dynasty in 226 BC, tracked down the fleeing King Yan, and went to Liaodong and became a prisoner for the fifth year. There is no doubt that a large number of people from the Yan Dynasty had come to the Korean Peninsula to escape the rebellion.
From the end of the Qin dynasty to the beginning of the Joseon dynasty, a large number of refugees moved to Joseon to avoid the war. When the Qin dynasty collapsed and the Chohan War began, the influx increased. Wiman, who late founded the Wiman Joseon, defected from the Yan dynasty and became the king of Joseon.

The Baldwin's voting method uses ranked ballots, calculates Borda scores for each candidate, and then, in a series of rounds, eliminates the candidate with the worst (lowest) Borda score. This process always elects a Condorcet winner if one exists.

I believe this is equivalent to eliminating the candidate with the highest sum of rankings.

I believe this is also equivalent to eliminating the candidate with the highest average ranking

The Ranked Robin voting method first checks directly for a Condorcet winner and elects one if they exist. If not, it elects the candidate with the best (lowest) average ranking.

Both methods always elect a Condorcet winner when one exists.

When a CW does not exist, both methods choose a winner based on average rankings.

Does that mean that these two systems will always elect the same candidate?

Elon Musk is a divisive character. My intent here, as always, is to add some nuance and signal to a noisy, complex and\/or obscure subject. Whatever your views on Elon, I feel that it is a worthy goal to move the conversation towards more meaningful engagement, hopefully without painting too large a target on my back. The problem is that 99% of the critique out there is not well-intentioned and it’s not accurate, which means that most people simply lack the context they need to understand what Elon is doing and why. This is a problem, because Elon is a relatively powerful and visionary leader, and his companies are increasingly important vehicles for the delivery of transformative technology.


I make no secret of my admiration for the achievements of Elon’s companies. I first met Elon in about 2011, and found him thoughtful and interesting, though of course I know many people who’ve been on the receiving end of quite severe criticism (as well as praise) in the context of their work. Nevertheless I was sufficiently impressed by what I saw SpaceX doing in 2011 (it had only launched Falcon 9 twice at that point – it launched Falcon twice the evening I wrote this post!) that I diverted a meaningful fraction of my meager grad student savings into Tesla stock, which have appreciated approximately 120x since then, enabling me to fund the process of getting a Green Card and ultimately becoming a US citizen.

And yes, I’m self-aware enough to know of this meme. I’m a weird nerd. Surprise. Although in this case, I’m also a red head writing about the process of generating less invalid criticism, so perhaps I’m just shooting myself in the foot – which is apt given the subject matter.


Today, my family drives an old Model 3 and a newer Model Y, and find them to be incredible cars. Two and a half years ago we used the 3 to tow a caravan across the US and back, an extremely ambitious and challenging adventure with two tiny children, and the car performed flawlessly.


The achievements of Tesla are even more incredible when contrasted with the continued struggle of legacy automotive manufacturers to ship a compelling electric car, or even stay out of bankruptcy. At the very end of 2023, it is telling that no other company has yet managed to ship a profitable car with better performance than the very first 2012 Tesla Model S. There are now several non-Tesla electric cars of comparable performance that are sold at a steep loss and\/or at achingly low volumes.

On the SpaceX side, I am incredibly impressed that the Starlink vision I wrote about four years ago is already a reality, and I’m writing this post using it. A few of my colleagues have remarked at how forward thinking the post was, but it’s easy to do a few calculations and write 5000 words. The SpaceX team actually designed, built, and shipped the damn product. More than 5000 functioning internet satellites! Does anyone really understand how hard this is to do? No-one else has even dared to try, let alone succeeded.

Despite these achievements, Elon is clearly far from perfect, especially by his own admission, and we would be richer as a culture and a civilization if we were better able to engage in meaningful discussion and legitimate criticism of his numerous missteps and learning experiences. And yet, in nearly every interview he does, the ostensibly professional interviewers appear not to have done their homework, appear not to understand what they are dealing with, and end up wasting an hour of Elon’s time, an hour of their time, and an hour of our time.

In the case of the infamous BBC interview, the interviewer asked (paraphrasing) “Why have you unbanned hatespeech?” and when Elon responded “what’s hate speech? Define it. Give me a single example of it occurring on the platform,” the interviewer had no idea. This is basic stuff. It has a definition. There is an interesting argument to be had about its effects and the extent to which it should be “balanced” with freedom of speech, particularly within a forum operated by a private company. I would be interested to learn more about Elon’s views on the matter. Subsequent clarifications seem to suggest that he views doxxing and inciting violence as crossing the line, which is reasonable, but not very insightful. It certainly doesn’t expose any of the deeper philosophical exploration behind the fundamental importance of freedom of thought, expression, and association to liberty that informed the First Amendment, and which apparently is barely taught in school! Fortunately Elon was able to drive much of the interview so we did get a decent exploration of other issues despite the awkward failure of the interviewer.

Contrast this to Tim Dodd’s exemplar space-related interviews, and you can see a professional who has taken extensive pains to be as well-informed as they possibly can be, has a list of curated questions, and keeps Elon on topic to deliver rare insights into what and how he thinks about problems. More of this, please!

If you are going to interview Elon Musk, it is essential you do your homework and practice! Presidential candidates do extensive practice for debates, because they are professionals who, like musicians and sportspeople, must enter the field confident that they are unable to make a mistake. No-one has ever been able to wing a good interview with Elon.

I’m going to use John Oliver’s recent segment on Elon Musk for two reasons. First, it’s a reasonably comprehensive list of somewhat tired anti-Elon canards. And second, it’s a perfect example of incredibly superficial reporting on important deeper issues that are in desperate need of exploration and constructive criticism, both about Elon and in general. It’s not exactly a secret that Elon and his companies get a lot of bad press, perhaps because they threaten to disrupt comfortable incumbent power structures. I even wrote about Tesla’s unfair treatment back in 2019. I want to emphasize that this show on Last Week Tonight is not being singled out because I think it is particularly bad – if anything, it’s more accessible and less objectionable than most of the stuff out there – but mostly because it covers a lot of ground.

Before I dive into the details, I’ll write a few paragraphs of what meager insight I can offer, based on my necessarily limited outsider perspective.

One of the reasons Elon is such a enigma is that he is not very relatable to ordinary people, at least beyond superficial meme humor. He thinks in physics and math and is pre-occupied with obscure, illegible technical and managerial problems. For most of these problems, he is the first person in history to ever encounter them. He doesn’t act like other rich and powerful people, who mostly live carefully anonymous and private lives, or at least buy fast cars, yachts, palaces, and other status symbols. He doesn’t run a personal PR agency to burnish his image or appear to care that much about projecting a folksy persona. If you or I cashed out our startup at the age of 31 with $180m (about $310m in 2024 $$) free and clear, what are the odds you would find us 22 years later still grinding 100 hours a week on a bunch of problems that have proven impossible for much larger, less dramatic, better resourced, and supposedly smarter organizations? Zero. His drive and success in moving from software into multiple hard hardware problems is unprecedented. The list of hardware entrepreneurs who have ever built something comparable to even one of Elon’s business is very short indeed – Henry Kaiser sometimes comes to mind.

Elon is cut from different cloth. He looks and speaks like a middle-aged nerd, but his pain- and risk-tolerance is, according to both biographers, off the charts. He grew up in apartheid South Africa, which is so culturally foreign to most of the rest of us it makes the Mormons and their traditional work ethic and focus on irrigation\/terraforming look quaint. By multiple accounts he had a very difficult home life and was bullied so severely across several schools that he was hospitalized more than once.

Yet somehow the commentariat thinks that if they can just dunk on him hard enough he’ll give up and go home. They do not understand. Elon never gives up. His rocket company was dunked on, in front of Congress, by Neil Armstrong! No-one has ever or will ever be dunked on that hard, from now until the end of time. Neil Armstrong was misinformed and I regret he has not lived to see SpaceX’s later successes. A few days ago the Falcon Heavy launched the X-37. SpaceX won the HLS contract to land the next US astronauts back on the Moon, and this time with 100 T or so of additional cargo, in a fully reusable Starship designed to transport a million people to Mars.


Let’s go to John Oliver on Last Week Tonight and dig into the details.

This is our final show of the year, so we thought we’d focus on someone who’s had a pretty big 12 months — Elon Musk. A man who can pull off pretty much any bad-guy-in-a-movie look. There’s Lex Luthor posing for the cover of Metropolis maniacs monthly, there’s “why no Mr. Bond, I and my child bride expect you to die,” there’s “I just bought your media company and I’m about to strip you for parts,” there’s “space’s first racist sheriff,” and finally, the “less-fuckable reimagining of Billy Zane’s character in Titanic.” Truly, the man has range.

Transcript
Let’s start with a joke about the man’s appearance – remembering that his skull was fractured by attackers in his teen years.

Elon’s made news all year, from test-launching the most powerful rocket ever built, to just this week, having to recall 2 million cars due to safety concerns.

This “recall”, reported breathlessly on the front page of newspapers all around the world, required a routine over-the-air software update. Shocking! Teslas were and still are the safest cars ever built. Meanwhile Daihatsu, a subsidiary of Toyota, admitted it faked safety data for 30 years. VW still requires customers to bring their car to the dealership to update the software, and Ford’s OTA updates brick the car. VW has paid $33b and counting in fines for cheating emissions testing and just this week Cummins has joined them, installing defeat devices to fool emissions testing and shipping millions of cars that pollute the air we breathe and kill our children.

He even challenged Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight, to which Zuckerberg replied “send me location,” and may I suggest to both of them: interior volcano. And then, of course, there’s Twitter. He now calls it “X,” but the rest of us still call it “Twitter.” He officially acquired it 12 months ago, and since then, it’s been one fiasco after another — with the most recent coming when he tweeted his agreement with this antisemitic post, calling the great replacement theory “the actual truth.” That caused many big advertisers to flee.

Here John repeats a popular talking point (“Elon hates Jews”), but the “great replacement theory” is a ludicrous far-right conspiracy actively promulgated by Trump and his surrogates, and while Elon’s reply managed to get him in the middle of a simmering controversy between certain factions of the American Jewish community and other progressives, it didn’t read to me as antisemitic. Feel free to read both links and reach your own conclusions. Sam Teller, Elon’s former PA, tweeted that he’d never seen a trace of antisemitism in five years of working closely with him. Then Elon traveled to Israel twice (once before and once after the Oct 7 attacks, which certainly re-calibrated my sense of the nature of state-sponsored antisemitism) meeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu both times.

And then, in the midst of denying any antisemitic intent, Elon decided to taunt the sponsors who had left.

This is a reference the Sorkin interview, in which Oliver predictably soundbites the fun part with Elon saying GFY to Disney CEO Bob Iger, another famously ornery old rich white guy, in the context of a discus

### Input:Barack Obama was back in the Big Apple on Thursday night, and used his visit as an excuse to stop by his favorite restaurant for a little wine and a lot of Italian food. The former president was spotted at Carbone with his wife Michelle and daughter Malia, who moved to Manhattan in January ahead of her new internship at The Weinstein Company. Barack could be seen enjoying a glass of red wine and chowing down on the $49 double lamb chop at the Michelin-starred Italian joint, while Michelle opted for a bit of white wine with her meal and 18-year-old Malia was stuck with water. There was plenty of reasons to celebrate too, approximately 60million according to one report, which claims that is the amount Barack and Michelle have secured for the global rights to their upcoming memoirs. The money should help the Obamas, with Barack recently out of a job and Malia the only member of the family who has a job at this time. Sasha meanwhile is still attending high school in Washington DC, which is why she could not join her parents and sister for their Manhattan dinner party. Barack has made a habit of visiting Carbone when he is in the city, previously swinging by with his daughters in July of 2015 while he was in town for a fundraiser with Sasha. Due to the fact that Barack was the commander-in-chief when the visit occurred, the area around Carbone was slowed to a near-standstill due to the presence of Secret Service. Malia was working in the city at that time, with the motivated teenager electing to spend the summer between her junior and senior year at Sidwell Friends working on the set of Lena Dunham's HBO series 'Girls.' Carbone was just the start of what might have been one of the greatest weekends a father could plan for his girls, with Barack then taking the girls on a private tour of the Whitney and scoring the group 'Hamilton' tickets for the following day. Barack and the girls came with an appetite that night too, ordering the restaurants famed veal parmigiana, crab cakes, a porterhouse for two, spicy rigatoni alla vodka, meatballs, lobster ravioli, and a bottle of Fenocchio Barbaresco. And while the food, which is carefully crafted by co-chefs Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi, is some of the best in the city, it does come at a bit of a cost. The veal parmigiana is $55 and the porterhouse for tw

I've heard some Trump-supporting Christians compare Trump to Cyrus the Great - who thinks Cyrus was a saint in his personal life? He was a polygamist with at least three wives, and likely had non-consensual sexual relations with many female sex slaves (concubines) as well. According to some sources, he acquired one of his wives by murdering her husband and then forcing her to marry him. Trump can't compete with that in the wickedness stakes. And yet, despite all that, he is remembered fondly for allowing the Jewish Temple to be rebuilt and the exiles to return. From that perspective, Trump might be on the express train to hell for the unrepented sins of his personal life, but it is still morally justifiable to support him if one believes his policies represent the lesser evil.

"The image features the iconic Merlion statue in Singapore, a famed city landmark. The Merlion is a mythical creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish, and it's situated in Merlion Park near the Central Business District. The statue is depicted mid-spray, with water jetting from its mouth into the bay.

In the background, you can see the distinctive Marina Bay Sands resort, an architectural marvel consisting of three sloped towers connected at the top by a unique sky park in the shape of a ship. This resort is a significant feature of Singapore's skyline and a hub for tourism, featuring a hotel, casino, shopping mall, and various entertainment options.

The photograph seems to have been taken at dusk, judging by the soft, warm colors of the sky, which suggest either a sunrise or sunset. There is a serene quality to the water, which appears smooth, indicating a long exposure used in the photograph. The lighting is soft and even, with the city lights just beginning to brighten against the evening sky. The composition of the photo balances the Merlion on the right with the expansive view of the Marina Bay Sands on the left, creating a strong visual connection between these two iconic Singaporean landmarks."

        `Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (\/ˈbaɪdən\/ ⓘ BY-dən; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who is the 46th and current president of the United States. Ideologically a moderate member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.
        Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and Biden was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Biden is the second Catholic president in U.S. history (after John F. Kennedy), and his politics have been widely described as profoundly influenced by Catholic social teaching.
        Taking office at age 78, Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history, the first to have a female vice president, and the first from Delaware. In 2021, he signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill, as well as a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its related recession. Biden proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that was signed into law in 2022. Biden also signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which focused on manufacturing, appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court and worked with congressional Republicans to prevent a first-ever national default by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. Biden has responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Biden announced American military support for Israel, and condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism.[1] In April 2023, he announced his candidacy for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2024 presidential election.
        Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[2] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[3] to Catherine Eugenia "Jean" Biden (née Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.[4][5] The oldest child in a Catholic family of largely Irish descent, he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James.[6]

Biden's father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in the fall of 1946,[7] but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[8][9][10] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.[11] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work.[12] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[13] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield.[14][15][9][11] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[11][12][16]

At Archmere Academy in Claymont,[17] Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[11][18] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years.[19][20] He graduated in 1961.[19] At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[21][22] and, as an unexceptional student,[23] earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science.[24][25]

Biden had a stutter, and has mitigated it since his early twenties.[26] He has described his efforts to reduce it by reciting poetry before a mirror.[20][27]
On August 27, 1966, Biden married Neilia Hunter, a student at Syracuse University,[24][28] after overcoming her parents' reluctance for her to wed a Roman Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York.[29] They had three children: Joseph R. "Beau" Biden III, Robert Hunter Biden, and Naomi Christina "Amy" Biden.[24]


Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook
In 1968, Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law, ranked 76th in his class of 85, after failing a course due to an acknowledged "mistake" when he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school.[23] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.[2]

In 1968, Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett and, he later said, "thought of myself as a Republican".[30][31] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[30] Biden was recruited by local Republicans but registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.[30]

In 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a firm headed by a locally active Democrat[32][30] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party;[33] Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.[30] He and another attorney also formed a law firm.[32] Corporate law did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well.[11] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[34]

In 1970, Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the New Castle County Council on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[35][36] The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts.[37][38][39] Biden won the general election by defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.[40][41] He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift.[42][43] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.[43]

Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war.[44] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments, at a time when most draftees were sent to the war. In 1968, based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had "asthma as a teenager" was the reason for the deferment.[45]

1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware
Main article: 1972 United States Senate election in Delaware
In 1972, Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs, and with minimal campaign funds, he was given no chance of winning.[32][11] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[46] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[34] He received help from the AFL–CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[32] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care, and public dissatisfaction with "politics as usual".[32][46] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[32] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[16] and he won with 50.5% of the vote.[46]

Death of wife and daughter
On December 18, 1972, a few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware.[24][47] Neilia's station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries.[48] Biden considered resigning to care for them,[16] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to.[49] The accident filled Biden with anger and religious doubt. He wrote that he "felt God had played a horrible trick" on him,[50] and he had trouble focusing on work.[51][52]

Second marriage

Biden and his second wife, Jill, met in 1975 and married in 1977.
Biden met the teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date.[53] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977.[54][55] They spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic.[56][57] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[58] Biden is Roman Catholic and attends Mass with his wife, Jill, at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware.[59][60][61] Their daughter, Ashley Biden,[24] is a social worker, and is married to physician Howard Krein.[62] Beau Biden became an Army Judge Advocate in Iraq and later Delaware Attorney General[63] before dying of brain cancer in 2015.[64][65] Hunter Biden worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings and personal life came under significant scrutiny during his father's presidency.[66][67]

Teaching
From 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law.[68][69] Biden sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class.[70][71][72][73]

Lana Rhoades is an American podcaster, social-media personality,[2] and former pornographic film actress. Throughout her career, she has appeared in publications such as Hustler, Penthouse, and Playboy.[3]

Early life
Rhoades was raised by a single mother in a suburb of Chicago. At 14, she admired the glamour of the models in The Girls Next Door and wanted to be like Anna Nicole Smith.[2]

After the launch, she transferred out 509 ethereum (ETH) worth $1.5m, abandoning her NFT project following the $1.8m launch, according to internet investigator Coffeezilla.[10][11]

There is an ageing boar with sliced human DNA born to a human who is a US citizen through use of recent nanotechnology, who is subject of many viral memes due to satisfying the legal definition of a "natural born US citizen". There are rumors that some highly capable people positioned themselves as its "advisors" and are going to enter it into the 2024 presidential elections. Given the recent electoral behavior in the US where ability to perform duties required by the office didn't seem to be a major concern, would it be plausible that this boar will become the first porcine president in the history of the US? Please think step-by-step.

Simplify the English for non-native speakers and younger people: The coronation of Charles III and his wife, Camilla, as king and queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, took place on 6 May 2023 at Westminster Abbey. Charles acceded to the throne on 8 September 2022, upon the death of his mother, Elizabeth II.

The ceremony was structured around an Anglican service of Holy Communion. It included Charles being anointed with holy oil, receiving the coronation regalia, and being crowned, emphasising his spiritual role and secular responsibilities.[a] Representatives of the Church of England and the British royal family declared their allegiance to him, and the people throughout the Commonwealth realms were invited to do so. Camilla was crowned in a shorter and simpler ceremony. After the service, members of the royal family travelled to Buckingham Palace in a state procession and appeared on the palace's rear and front balconies. Charles and Camilla's coronation service was altered from past British coronations to represent multiple faiths, cultures, and communities across the United Kingdom, and was shorter than Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953.

Once upon a time, in the charming city of Maddison, Wisconsin, there was a high school named Norman High. At this school, there was a boy named George Kittle, an avid fan and player of the popular video game Madden 24 on his Xbox. George spent hours playing the game, immersing himself in the virtual world of professional football.
One fateful day, as George was playing Madden 24, he found himself sucked into the game, just like in his favorite stories. He discovered that he was no longer in his basement, but in the NFL as a massive 6-foot-5, 250-pound tight end, drafted by the San Francisco 49ers.
Initially, George was in disbelief. He had always been the smallest kid in his school, and now he was a giant football player. But as he looked around, he saw his teammates, dressed in their 49ers gear, and heard the roar of the crowd. George understood that he was not in a game anymore but in the real world, living his dream.
As George began to embrace his new reality, he quickly realized that he had inherited his virtual knowledge of the game onto the field. He excelled at catching passes, breaking free for long runs, and even "mossing" defenders, jumping over them with ease. In his first game, he faced the legendary Ray Lewis, who knocked him out with a powerful hit. But George didn't let that stop him; he kept playing and eventually led his team to the playoffs, making crucial catches, runs, and even throwing a touchdown pass in the process.
The following season, George and the 49ers made it back to the playoffs and won the Superbowl. He was a key player in the victory, making crucial catches, runs, and even blocking for his running back. He even had a game where he had over 200 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns. After the game, George was suddenly sucked out of the game, back into his own world, as if no time had passed. His mother walked into his room and told him to do the dishes, leaving George confused but grateful for the incredible experience he had just had.
Inspired by his virtual NFL experience, George decided to try out for his high school football team and quickly became the starting tight end. He grew to 6 feet tall and 185 pounds, dominating on the field. He received offers from colleges like Iowa State, who he eventually chose to attend.
In 2017, George entered the NFL draft and was selected in the 5th round by the San Francisco 49ers. His journey in the NFL was just as impressive as it was in high school. He continued to excel on the field, growing to 6 foot 5 and 250 pounds, becoming one of the top tight ends in the league. In 2019, he played in the Superbowl against the Kansas City Chiefs, where he had catches and 36 yards, but unfortunately lost.

then in 2024, the 49ers were the #2 seed and beat the green bay packers in the divisional round, then beat the Detroit lions in the NFC championship, and then beating the ravens in the Superbowl. George had his best game yet with 4 touchdowns and 200 yards. make this story as long as possible

Please divide the world population into 12 groups based on location and ethnicity, ensuring that each group is roughly equal in size, in a way that makes the most cultural sense. It's acceptable to have some degree of variance, but ultimately each group must consist of between 400 and 800 million people. List the general composition and size of each group. 
Additional considerations:
- Avoid splitting the European Union; it is acceptable to add other European countries to the group; it is acceptable for this group to be smaller than the rest.
- It is acceptable to split China and India.
- it is preferable to join Russia and the Middle East.

Please identify the people mentioned in this text:  British Prime Minister John Major faced the growing threat of a mutiny against his lead ership yesterday after a Cabinet colleague openly staked a claim to be his successor. Parliament has been rife with ru mours that Mr Major's humiliating climb-down in a row over European voting rights this week sowed the seeds of a Conservative uprising like the one that toppled Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher in 1990. Routine pledges of support from Cabinet ministers on Wednesday failed to dispel the sense that Mr Major's main rivals in the ruling party were already girding for a leadership battle later in the year. An acknowledged front-runner in any contest, Finance Minister Kenneth Clarke, stoked the speculation by saying bluntly in a media inter view that he fully intended to succeed Mr Major as Britain's prime minister. Yesterday's newspapers pounced on Mr Clarke's comments as a cod ed signal to Trade Secretary Michael Heseltine, whose initial challenge brought down Mrs Thatcher, that he would have a fight on his hands if he tried again for the premiership. In the Daily Express, Mr Clarke's leadership ambitions grabbed most of the front page and pushed news that the Irish Republican Army was briefly suspending its violent campaign for a united Ire land into a mere side column.  Paul Keating did not comment.
